                                    proposed the PDX-Minimum information (PDX-MI) standard, which defines the minimal
                                    information for describing the clinical attributes of a patientâ€™s tumor, the

        <h4> PDX data submission </h4><hr/>
        <p class="fillUp">
            Many academic and commercial sources of PDX models have emerged in recent years and the size of the resources and the processes for creating and characterizing PDX models and
            their related data is variable (e.g: custom database or individual files/tables collection). To account for this variability, multiple source data submission is achieved using
            bespoke automatic ingest pipelines.  PDX Data can be submitted by PDX producers via direct upload of files collection or via data access end-points (APIs). An interface for
            submitting PDX model metadata, as well as experimental data will be implemented in the future. A PDX producers can contact the PDX Finder via email to submit their data into the
            resource <a href="mailto:helpdesk@pdxfinder.org?cc=helpdesk2@pdxfinder.org&subject=PDX%20PRODUCER:%20DATA%20SUBMISSION%20REQUEST&body=Body-goes-here">(helpdesk@pdxfinder.org)</a>.

        <h4> PDX data standardization and harmonization </h4><hr/>
        <p class="fillUp">
            PDX data is stored in a secure Neo4j graph database which provides a powerful framework for storage, querying and envisioning of biological data. Following data submission, data
            standardization (adherence to PDX-Minimum information standard) and harmonization is necessary to ensure cross-source data integration. More specifically, PDX model metadata
            includes clinical, chemical and experimental factors that can be described in a number of ways. Most producers of PDX models adhere to an internal vocabulary partially based on
            community-developed standards. For example, cancer diagnosis are represented at different resources with <a href="https://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser" target="_blank"> NCI-Thesaurus </a>,
            <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html" target="_blank">MeSH</a>, and the <a href="http://disease-ontology.org" target="_blank">Disease Ontology</a> . Other descriptors use free text or
            a mix of generic, commercial and chemical labels (e.g drugs). Expert knowledge is necessary to map between differing standards in order to achieve data harmonization.  As this is a major
            issue across bioinformatics, ontology resources tools like <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/spot/zooma" target="_blank">ZOOMA</a> have been developed to semi-automate mapping of standards
            which produce unified indexes that facilitate data query and discovery. Following database deposition, multiple source PDX data is standardized and harmonized in a two-step process using
            both Automated mappings of ontology terms with <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/spot/zooma" target="_blank">ZOOMA</a> and manual curation of remaining anomalous events. The automated
            standardization process will also check data compliance with the PDX Minimal Information standard and
            skip/report records that do not conform. The standardized and harmonized records will be then integrated into a cohesive ontological data model which supports consistent searching
            across sources. Ontological annotation will assist users in their search providing representation of the data and its relationship. For example, searching for 'Breast Cancer' related
            PDX models will allow users to uncover all subclasses of breast cancer models in a single query, without having to look for each subtype individually. Rather than impose a limited
            set of terms to describe a given minimal information attribute, we will accept a source's internal standards and generate unified semantic indexes to describe the models.  We will
            work with the PDX sources and local experts to will ensure the quality of the generated mappings and provide feedback to the developers of ontology tools.

        <h4> PDX data distribution </h4><hr/>
        <p class="fillUp">
            PDX data will be served through the PDX Finder interface allowing users query PDX models based on their research needs. To facilitate flexibility for users,
            multiple search attributes will be supported allowing various points of entry into the data (e.g: tumor type, diagnosis, molecular markers). Search results will be displayed in a
            table to allow easy visualization and further filtering and selection. Clickable links will allow users to drill down in their selected PDX model data to discover additional
            patient/tumor/model attributes and associated studies (e.g dose response studies, 'OMIC' datasets). Furthermore, links to the data sources the model originate from will be
            provided to allow users to contact the relevant institution for further collaboration/model acquisition.
