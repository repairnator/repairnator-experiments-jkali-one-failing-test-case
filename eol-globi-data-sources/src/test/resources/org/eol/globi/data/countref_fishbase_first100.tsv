The main lowlands are a series of river valleys in the north and various desert regions in the south and southwest. The Hindu Kush is the principal mountain system in Afghanistan. With its various offshoots, it extends for about 966 kilometres (about 600 miles) from the Pamirs range in the northeast to the border with Iran in the west. The average elevation of the Hindu Kush is about 4,270 metres (about 14,000 feet), but some peaks are as high as 7,620 metres (25,001 feet), with the highest peak, Tirich Mir, reaching 7,699 metres (25,260 feet).North of the Hindu Kush, the Turkestan Plains descend to the Amu Darya on the northern border. After broadening into the Hazarajat central plateau, the mountains level off into western deserts, such as the Rigestan.Natural passes penetrate the mountains of Afghanistan at various points, facilitating travel within the country as well as communication with neighbouring countries. In the Hindu Kush, the only pass lower than 3,050 metres (10,006 feet) is the Shebar Pass (2,987 metres/9,800 feet), which connects the Kabul region with the northern part of the country. The historic Khyber Pass on the northeastern border is the best known of the mountain passes. It traverses the Sulaiman Range and affords relatively easy access to Pakistan.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Afghanistan varies according to elevation and location. Kabul, for example, at 1,676 metres (about 5,499 feet) has cold winters and pleasant summers. Jalalabad (about 550 metres/about 1,805 feet high) is subtropical. Kandahar (1,006 metres/3,300 feet) is mild year-round. Overall, daytime temperatures may range from freezing at dawn to almost 38°C (100°F) at noon. Summer temperatures as high as 49°C (120°F) have been recorded in the northern valleys. Midwinter temperatures as low as 9°C (16°F) are common at the 1,980-metre (6,496-foot) level in the Hindu Kush.Afghanistan is a relatively dry country. Average annual rainfall is about 305 millimetres (about 12 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring between the months of October and April. Sandstorms are frequent in the deserts and arid plains.	12263	Afghanistan relies on four major river systems for its water: the Amu Darya, known in ancient times as the Oxus, on the border with Tajikistan; the Kabul, which flows into the Indus River; the Helmand in the south, the longest river in the country; and, in the west, the Harirud. All of these, with the exception of the Kabul, empty into lakes or swamps.	12263	Knowledge of the fish fauna is very fragmentary and many additional species should be expected. Of the 84 species reported from the country, 67 come from a single river basin. Considering the topography of the country, it seems likely that many species could have very restricted distributional ranges. Because Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world, the national report to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) identified socio-economic problems, such as poverty and poor health, rather than the environment, as the main areas of concern.\r\n\r\nThe following information is to be sought:\r\n- Existence of conservation plans;\r\n- Current major threats to species;\r\n- Future potential threats to species;\r\n- Contact(s) for further information.	12217	12263	null	111	0	14	0	53	0	20	1	18	0	22	0	0	10	0	9	0	-1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	null	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/af.html#	null	null	1	1993-11-22T00:00:00.000Z	393	2015-04-07T00:00:00.000Z	1	1996-11-21T00:00:00.000Z	??????????	&#913;&#966;&#947;&#945;&#957;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#940;&#957;	??????????	&#1040;&#1092;&#1075;&#1072;&#1085;&#1080;&#1089;&#1090;&#1072;&#1085;	Afghanistan	Afganistán	Afghanistan 	Afghanistan	Afeganistão	Afganistan	Afghanistan 	null

Mount Korab, Albania’s highest peak (2,751 metres/9,026 feet), is part of the rugged North Albanian Alps, which form the southern end of the Dinaric Alps. A narrow belt of lowlands along the coast of the Adriatic Sea north of Vlorë and several river valleys extending inland from the coast comprise less than one-quarter of the land area. The coastal lowlands have rich soil, but in many places the land is marshy or poorly drained. In the central and southern parts of the country, mountains are broken by high plateaus and basins.\r\n\r\nThe Adriatic coastal region has a Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Inland, a more severe continental climate prevails, with marked seasonal extremes of temperature. Average annual precipitation ranges from about 1,000 millimetres (about 39 inches) on the coast to nearly 2,500 millimetres (nearly 99 inches) in sections of the northern mountains. Summer precipitation is scant throughout the country.	12263	Most of Albania’s rivers rise in the eastern, mountainous region of the country and flow west to the Adriatic Sea. The largest of these are the Dhrínos, Shkumbi, and Mat, each with broad valleys. Albania shares its three large lakes with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, (FYROM) and Greece. Lake Scutari lies to the northwest, and Lake Ohrid and Lake Prespa are in the east.	12263	Issues facing Albania are soil erosion, deforestation, and water pollution from industrial and domestic effluents. The country is committed to international agreements concerning biodiversity and climatic change.\r\n\r\nThe following information is to be sought:\r\n- Status of knowledge of the freshwater fauna;\r\n- Existence of conservation plans;\r\n- Information on major aquatic habitats or sites within the country;\r\n- Current major threats to species;\r\n- Future potential threats to species;\r\n- Contact(s) for further information.	12263	null	null	68	19	13	1	62	3	33	1	16	1	35	0	0	27	0	17	0	0	280	58	2	0	254	0	24	0	29	0	123	0	0	35	0	12	null	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/al.html#	null	null	1	1993-11-13T00:00:00.000Z	97	2013-03-05T00:00:00.000Z	1	1996-12-18T00:00:00.000Z	???????	&#913;&#955;&#946;&#945;&#957;&#943;&#945;	???????	&#1040;&#1083;&#1073;&#1072;&#1085;&#1080;&#1103;	Albanie	Albania	Albanien 	Albanië	Albânia	Albania	Albanien 	null

Most of the country (86%) is situated within the Sahara desert. In the north the Atlas Mountains, rising to a maximum elevation of 2,328 m asl, provide surface runoff to a narrow fertile coastal strip which support most of the population.\r\nSummers are hot; winters are fairly mild. Rainfall is adequate along the coast, but the interior is dry with extremes of desert temperatures. The limited rainfall and runoff has fostered construction of storage dams to ensure adequate water supplies for crop irrigation. High salinities and irregular inflow limit the potential use of most natural lacustrine bodies.	11969	Lakes: there are no important freshwater lakes. Several internal drainage basins possess salt lakes and marshes. The largest basin, containing Lakes Chott Melshir and Chott Merouane, has a total area of 61,000 sq. km. with a mean annual inflow of 0.90 cu. km. Sebkha d'Oran is a large salt lake (296 sq. km.) lying near the coast in the west. To the northeast is the Oubeira Lake, 21 sq. km. For most salt lake basins only a small proportion of the area has standing water.\r\nRivers, floodplains and swamps: there are eleven river ("oued") basins which discharge into the Mediterranean Sea from a combined catchment area of 132,910 sq. km. The largest is the Oued Chelif (29,300 sq. km catchment; 0.55 cu. km. discharge). There are two important floodplains; Garaet el Mkhada (89 sq. km) and Chott Zahrez Chergui.\r\nRivers, floodplains and swamps: there are eleven river ("oued") basins which discharge into the Mediterranean Sea from a combined catchment area of 132,910 sq. km.

There are two important floodplains: Garaet el Mkhada (89 sq. km.) and Chott Zahrez Chergui.\r\nReservoirs: to date, some 21 large dams have been constructed. Most are for irrigation usage, and a smaller number produce hydroelectricity or supply municipalities. At present little fishery development has taken place in these reservoirs.\r\nCoastal lagoons: there is some small lagoon in the extreme east of the country: Mellah.	11969	Soil erosion from poor farming practices and overgrazing, along with the pollution of rivers, coastal waters and, in particular, the Mediterranean Sea, are of great concern. Fresh water is scarce in Algeria, but per capita consumption is low. Protected areas cover 5 per cent (1992) of Algeria, which has ratified many of the global agreements on wildlife and habitat.

There is a narrow coastal plain. The northern part of Angola is covered with rain forest.; the south is savanna merging into semi-arid desert. Cabinda is low-lying, tropical and densely forested.\r\nIn general, the north of Angola is tropical in climate, whereas the south is semiarid. The climate is largely conditioned by the cold Benguela current and gives a temperate character to the coastal regions. There are two main seasons: a cold, dry season from May to October; and a warm, wet season from November to April. During the cold period temperatures can drop to freezing on the plateau. Angola is a predominantly agricultural country with some mining in the northeastern region.	11967	Lakes: There are no large lakes in Angola, but there are numerous smaller bodies of water associated with the floodplains of river systems in the south and east of the country.\r\nRivers, floodplains and swamps: The country is, on the whole, well watered by rivers draining the central highland plateau. Poll (1967; Ref. 11970) assigns the rivers to five main basins corresponding to zoogeographical regions. These are:\r\n(a) the Zaire River basin, where major tributaries include the Kasai and Kwango rivers;\r\n(b) the Zambezi River basin with the headwaters of the Zambezi and its tributaries and Lungue and Cuando rivers, with some 20,000 km² of inundatable floodplain;\r\n(c) the Okavango River basin, with the Cuito and Cubango rivers;\r\n(d) the northern coastal rivers, chief of which is the Cuanza River; and\r\n(e) the Cunene River basin, including 15,000 km² of the Ovambo floodplain.\r\nThe major river channals total over 10,000 km in length, without counting small streams. Floodplains with numerous small lakes occur along the lower reaches of many of the rivers, discharging westward into the Atlantic Ocean.\r\nReservoirs: There are several impoundments; the largest are at Gove, on the Cunene, and Kiminha, on the Bengo. Several large reservoirs are projected for the future.\r\nCoastal lagoons: There are a few coastal lagoons; the largest are Buraco and Chissambe lagoons.	11967	Freshwater fishes of Angola are well known from a taxonomic point of view. However, their current status is uncertain. Almost all major westward flowing rivers are now impounded near the upstream end of their coastal floodplains, with undoubtedly adverse effects.  \r\nThe following information is to be sought:\r\n- Existence of conservation plans;\r\n- Current major threats to species;\r\n- Future potential threats to species;\r\n- Contact(s) for further information.	594	11967	null	238	29	1	1	61	0	15	97	37	0	27	22	41	4	0	1	-1	0	526	80	0	26	355	0	8	2	29	1	129	0	0	22	0	5	null	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/ao.html#	null	null	1	1993-11-17T00:00:00.000Z	97	2010-05-20T00:00:00.000Z	null	null	??????	&#913;&#947;&#954;&#972;&#955;&#945;	??????	&#1040;&#1085;&#1075;&#1086;&#1083;&#1072;	Angola	Angola	Angola 	Angola	Angola	Angola	Angola 	null

It includes the Leeward Islands of Antigua, Barbuda to the north, and Redonda Island to the southwest. Generally a low-lying island of limestone and sandstone, Antigua rises to 470 m at Boggy Peak. The white sandy beaches along the coastline are a major attraction for tourists. Barbuda, formerly called Dulcina, is a flat coral island with fine beaches. It is also a game reserve inhabited by wild deer, wild pigs, and a variety of fowl, including ducks and pigeons. Redonda Island is a rocky, uninhabited islet.\r\n\r\nAntigua and Barbuda has a tropical climate year-round, with a mean annual temperature of about 27°C. Although the country’s annual rainfall is about 114 cm, the islands are subject to drought, as well as occasional hurricanes.	12263	null	null	Coral reefs surround the small islands of Antigua and Barbuda. Because fishing has nearly doubled since 1980, these reefs have suffered some disturbance to their ecosystem. Almost 14 per cent (1992) of the area has protected status on such issues as nuclear testing, hazardous waste, depletion of the ozone layer, and whaling. Water management is another major area of concern because of limited natural freshwater resources.	12263	null	null	1	7	4	0	12	0	7	0	4	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	441	49	0	0	297	0	14	0	161	0	102	0	0	15	0	4	null	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/ac.html#	#http://caricom-fisheries.com/antigua-fisheries/#	null	1	1993-11-17T00:00:00.000Z	303	2014-05-01T00:00:00.000Z	null	null	????????? & ???????????	&#913;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#947;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#945;&#32;&#38;&#32;&#924;&#960;&#945;&#961;&#956;&#960;&#959;&#973;&#957;&#964;&#945;	??????? ? ???????	&#1040;&#1085;&#1090;&#1080;&#1075;&#1091;&#1072;&#32;&#1080;&#32;&#1041;&#1072;&#1088;&#1073;&#1091;&#1076;&#1072;	Antigua-et-Barbuda	Antigua y Barbuda	Antigua und Barbuda 	Antigua en Barbuda	Antígua e Barbuda	Antigua e Barbuda	Antigua och Barbuda	null

An Action Plan for Australian Freshwater Fishes was published in 1993 (Wager and Jackson, 1993). This included status assessments for all species along with detailed recovery outlines for threatened taxa. \r\n\r\nAustralia encompasses a wide variety of freshwater habitats and boasts a relative diverse fauna. Only four Australian species have evolved as primary freshwater species. The remainder have evolved from marine ancestors. Many of the inland Australian waters have very high salinities and may be several times more saline than sea water. Australia can be divided into nine more or less distinct divisions (ref 5259).  \r\n1. Southwestern Division. Contains mainly coastal rivers that are relatively short, flowing into the Indian and Southern Oceans between about Geraldton on the western coast and about Esperance on the southern coast. Most streams are generally narrow and relatively fast-flowing. Water temperatures are cool and support introduced trout populations. Most of the larger streams in the area have extensive estuaries at their mouths. The fish fauna is dominated by galaxiids.\r\n2. Pilbara Division. Rivers draining the central-western coast region of Western Australia and flowing into the Indian Ocean. Rainfall is generally sparse and some rivers are dry for several years in succession. Streams are generally slow-flowing ranging from clear conditions inland to turbid conditions near the coast. Grunters and gudgeons comprise around half of the fauna.\r\n3. Kimberley-Arnhem Land Division. Includes the relatively hilly terrain in the far north of Western Australia and the adjacent  part of Northern Territory. Streams are characteristically shaded. This is one of the wettest regions of Australia. The fauna is dominated by grunters and gudgeons.\r\n4. Gulf of Carpentaria Division. This region overlaps with the Arnhem Land division to the west and the Eastern Coastal division. Some of the rivers extend for hundreds of kilometres inland. Rivers are generally sluggish and turbid. Many of the species are shared with southern New Guinea.\r\n5. Eastern Coastal Division. This is an extensive narrow coastal region extending from the tip of the Cape York Peninsula southward to Cape Howe and west to the South Australia border. It can be subdivided into northeastern and southeastern portions, the dividing line being the New South Wales-Queensland border. In the north there are peat-stained creeks and ponds in the coastal dune systems and tropical rainforests. The southeastern segment is extensively settled by man with pockets of rainforest, coastal heathlands and dune lakes and estuaries. Gudgeons are one of the largest groups throughout the region and galaxiids are particularly common in the south.\r\n6. Tasmanian Division. The terrain is largely mountainous and precipitation is substantial. Much of the island is heavily forested and there are numerous man-made and natural lakes. The most remarkable element of the fauna are the galaxiids, many of which are endemic to Tasmania.\r\n7. South Australian Gulf Division. The small area consists of streams in the vicinity of Adelaide draining into the Gulf of St. Vincent and the nearby Spencer Gulf. The streams are generally short and often stop flowing during the dry summer months.\r\n8. Murray-Darling Division. The combined Murray-Darling River System is the largest in Australia, rising in the interior of southern Queensland and flowing southeastward for 1900 km to the Southern Ocean. The headwaters of the Murray consist of forested mountain terrain and high plains, whereas much of the Darling originates in gentler terrain with dry forest and low scrub bordering on desert conditions. This division is also greatly affected by man's activities, particularly land clearing and construction of dams for agricultural purposes. The fauna is dominated by galaxiids, percichthyids and gudgeons.\r\n9. Lake Eyre and Adjacent Internal Divisions. This region encompasses much of the central interior and is characterised by featureless desert plains, low-lying hills and gorges around Alice Springs. Temperature and salinity regimes are subject to broad fluctuations and fishes in this area are hardy and well-adapted. Common species in the fauna include plotosid catfishes, hardyheads and grunters.\r\nAround 25% of Australian freshwater fishes are considered to have either significantly declined in distribution or are found in restricted areas. Although no fish species are known to have become extinct since European settlement, one species has become extinct in the wild. Habitat degradation and/or interactions with introduced species appear to be the main causes of declining fish populations. Many processes threaten habitat and are often interlinked They include changes to natural flow regimes, clearing of catchment vegetation, increased sediment loads, alteration of river bed and banks, reduced water quality and artificial barriers to ations.

Many processes threaten habitat and are often interlinked They include changes to natural flow regimes, clearing of catchment vegetation, increased sediment loads, alteration of river bed and banks, reduced water quality and artificial barriers to fish movement. Brown trout (Salmo trutta) and Gambusia (Gambusia holbrooki) appear to be the introduced species of most threat to native species at present. The majority of the species listed as threatened in the Action Plan are found in the south-east. While this may reflect the areas of most severe habitat degradation it may also reflect the lack of adequate survey work elsewhere.\r\nThe major factor limiting development of adequate recovery outlines for freshwater fishes remains the lack of biological data, particularly relating to habitat requirements. It is recommended that the Australian Action Plan be reviewed every five years.\r\n\r\nContacts: Rob Wager and Peter Jackson, Queensland Depart of Primary Industries, Fisheries Division, GPO Box 46, Brisbane, Queensland 4001, AUSTRALIA.	5259	11236	null	186	130	31	22	73	17	21	27	41	25	24	139	6	34	4	2	0	-1	4095	376	8	212	1068	7	67	225	672	76	252	398	106	59	18	16	null	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/as.html#	#http://www.csiro.au/#	null	1	1993-11-13T00:00:00.000Z	97	2010-05-20T00:00:00.000Z	null	null	?????????	&#913;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#955;&#943;&#945;	?????????	&#1040;&#1074;&#1089;&#1090;&#1088;&#1072;&#1083;&#1080;&#1103;	Australie	Australia	Australien 	Australië	Austrália	Australia	Australien 	null

At it's eastern and south-eastern margin are the low-elevation Lusai and Garo Hills. The main tributaries of the Ganges are the Mathabanga, Ichamati, Bhairab, Kumar, Chitra, Nabaganga, Garai-Madhumati and Arial Khan. East of the Garai-Madhumati is an active area of the delta where rapid sedimentation is occurring. The Sunderbans in the extreme south form an area of mangrove forests and swamps that extend for about 165 km from east to west. The eastern hills rise to a maximum elevation of 600 m. The main rivers of this area are the Surma, Karnafuli, Halda, Kassalong, Sangu and Muhari. The northern part of Bangladesh is noted for its torrential streams, including the Mahananda, Korotoa, Jabuneswari, Teesta, Kangsha and Someswari. In the monsoon these streams carry large amounts of silt from the mountains to the plains below.\r\n\r\nBangladesh has a humid climate with warm summers and cool winters. The monsoon is the most important climatic factor. About 80 percent of the annual rainfall typically occurs during the summer monsoon period, which lasts from late May to mid-October. April is the hottest month, averaging about 28°C (about 82°F). The coldest month is January, with an average temperature of 18°C (64°F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 1,400 millimetres (about 55 inches) along the country’s east central border, to more than 5,080 millimetres (more than 200 inches) in the far northeast. Besides the normal monsoon-type rainfall, Bangladesh is subject to devastating cyclones in the months of April and May, and again from September to November.	12263	Bangladesh has vast areas of freshwater. The inland water areas comprise the following:\r\n\r\n     rivers, canals, estuaries: 1,003,000 ha\r\n     natural depressions: 114,161 ha\r\n     ponds and tanks: 161,943 ha\r\n     ox-bows: 5,488 ha\r\n     Karnafauli Reservoir: 68,800 ha\r\n     flood plains: 2,800,000 ha\r\n     brackish water: 87,300 ha\r\n\r\nRivers, canals and estuaries\r\n\r\nRivers and canals cover roughly 5.8% of the total area of the country. Annual flooding of the rivers innundates about 70% of the total land surface. During the rainy season, rivers carry a heavy silt load. The southern portion of the Gangetic delta bordering the Bay of Bengal includes rivers with high tidal action and areas of mangroves. During high tide salt water enters freshwater rivers. In 1986-7 rivers and estuaries provided an estimated 195,117 tonnes of fish.\r\n\r\nThe minnows and carps (Family Cyprinidae) and catfishes from 11 families and 30 genera are the most important riverine species. Important commercial species include the major carps, the Ayre, the chital and the boal. The river shad is anadramous and forms the largest single species fishery in inland water. Hill streams in the north of the country are swift flowing and clear.\r\n\r\nFloodplain\r\n\r\nBangladesh has a very extensive floodplain. The area is seasonally inundated by overspill from adjacent rivers, lakes and natural depressions. During the dry season there is an accumulation of animal dung, rotting vegetation and other materials. This material rapidly dissolves during early stages of flooding and results in an increase in productivity that provides essential conditions for reproduction, feeding and growth of many fish species. The floodplain produced 183,796 tonnes of fish in 1986-7.\r\n\r\nBeels, Haors and Baors\r\n\r\n'Beels' and  'haors' are natural depressions situated mainly in the northern half of the country with the largest concentration in old Sylhet and Mymensingh districts. The term  'haor' denotes depressions which are larger in size and resemble inland seas during the monsoon. The term  'beel' denotes natural depressions of smaller size. These areas produced an estimated 42,007 tonnes of fish in 1986-7.\r\n\r\n'Baors' are also natural depressions usually formed by a change of course of rivers. Most baors are located in Jessore, Kushtia and Faridpur districts. Total estimated fish production from baors was estimated to be 1,174 tonnes in 1986-7.\r\n\r\nPonds, Tanks and Dighis\r\n\r\nThere are thought to be between 1.3 and 1.7 million ponds in Bangladesh, varying in size from 0.1 acres to about 75 acres. Estimated fish production from ponds was 142,876 tonnes in 1986-7, which is approximately 17% of the total fish production for the country. The main species in aquaculture are various native and introduced carp species. Ponds are frequently found in Comilla, Noakhali and Faridpur districts.\r\n\r\nMany of the flood plains and also the hillstreams on the Bangladesh-Myanmar border are sites of exceptional biodiversity interest (Ref. 12217).	1479	Bangladesh faces a multitude of environmental problems, including limited access to potable water, various water-borne diseases, the overuse of commercial pesticides, intermittent water shortages, soil degradation, deforestation, and severe overpopulation. The country is experimenting with integrated pest control programs, such as the use of natural predators, and is a signatory of several international agreements related to, among other matters, ozone-layer protection, hazardous waste, and environmental modification.\r\n\r\nThough there is a list of freshwater fishes of Bangladesh, there is little information on the status of species within the country.\r\n\r\nThe following information is to be sought:\r\n- Existence of conservation plans;\r\n- Current major threats to species;\r\n- Future potential threats to species;\r\n- Contact(s) for further information.	12217	4832	4833	174	44	11	24	99	9	27	3	50	4	25	1	2	4	0	0	0	0	190	146	0	16	292	0	35	0	32	0	105	0	0	11	0	1	null	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/bg.html#	null	null	1	1993-11-17T00:00:00.000Z	97	2010-05-20T00:00:00.000Z	null	null	???????????	&#924;&#960;&#945;&#947;&#954;&#955;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#941;&#962;	?????????	&#1041;&#1072;&#1085;&#1075;&#1083;&#1072;&#1076;&#1077;&#1096;	Bangladesh	Bangladesh	Bangladesh 	Bangladesh	Bangladeche	Bangladesh	Bangladesh 	null

There has been almost no industrial development in the country: about 95% of the population is\r\nprimarily dependent on agriculture and animal husbandry. The Himalayan Chain runs along the northern border and the interior of the country is made up of a series of six major north-south-aligned mountain ranges. The largest of these, the Black Mountains, rise to nearly 5,000 m and form a substantial physical barrier between eastern and western Bhutan. Four of the seven river valleys merge to form the Manas and all of them flow southwards across the plains of West Bengal and Assam into the Brahmaputra. The enormous altitudinal range and varied climatic conditions are reflected in the country's great ecological diversity, ranging from tropical moist\r\ndeciduous forest along the southern foothills, through extensive broad-leaved and coniferous forests across the middle of the country, to alpine scrub and meadows up to the permanent snowline to the north.\r\n\r\nBhutan's most valuable natural resources are its forests and major river systems. Most of the original forest remains. In 1978 it was estimated that 53% of Bhutan was forested, of which 19% was broad-leaved evergreen forest and 34% deciduous and coniferous. The remaining land cover comprised snow/water/scree (19%) and pasture/scrub/arable (28%). There was extensive\r\ncommercial exploitation of forest resources up until 1979, when logging operatives were nationalised and severe restrictions imposed on the export of timber in the interests of sound forestry management and ecological stability (World Bank, 1984, 1986).\r\n\r\nClimate varies from subtropical on the Duars to temperate in the mountain valleys, with increasingly severe weather at higher elevations. Average annual precipitation is generally heavy, ranging from about 1,520 millimetres in the mountain valleys to more than 5,080 millimetres in the Duars.	12249	The conservation importance of the major rivers (Torsa/Ammo Chu, Paidak/Wong Chu, Sankosh/Mo Chu and Manas) is reviewed by Scott (1989). Rivers are generally rocky and fast-flowing, with marshes restricted to flat valley bottoms in the inner valleys. Most marshes have been drained for agricultural purposes but some of those remaining are of international\r\nimportance for black-necked crane.	12247	About 66 per cent (1993) of Bhutan is covered in forests and woodlands, and many diverse species of plants and animals inhabit the country. Population growth is increasing the demand for fuelwood and causing pressure on the 2 per cent (1993) of land that can be used for farming or pasture. Soil erosion is a serious problem in Bhutan, as is poor access to potable water and sanitation. Nevertheless, preservation of the environment is part of the country’s tradition and government policy, and 21 per cent (1992) of the land is protected.\r\n\r\nThere is apparently no specific publication on the fishes of Bhutan. There are a few scattered references in publications on Indian fishes.\r\n\r\nThreatened Species\r\nThere is no information on threatened species of fishes in Bhutan. However, Bhutan's natural resources are becoming increasingly threatened. While less pronounced than in other parts of the Himalaya, there is substantial evidence that uplands in Bhutan are being degraded at accelerating rates (Denholm, 1990, Thinley, 1989). The main conservation problem is the\r\nconversion of forests to other forms of land use as a result of human settlement, high domestic consumption of fuelwood and timber, shifting cultivation, overgrazing and encroachment, all of which reflect the rising human population (Blower, 1985, Jackson, 1981, Mahat, 1985, Sargent, 1985).\r\n\r\nForests are grazed by excessive numbers of domestic livestock and are burnt, while the wildlife is declining due to habitat destruction, grazing competition with domestic livestock and, in some southern areas, organised poaching (Blower, 1985). The southernmost forest belt has been almost completely cleared for human settlement (Mahat, 1985). People are concentrated in the fertile valleys and, in the south-western foothills, at densities approaching an upper limit given present production methods, which are unlikely to change in the near future (Jackson, 1981).	12243	12241	12242	41	0	8	1	33	0	12	0	12	0	15	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	null	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/bt.html#	null	null	1	1993-11-19T00:00:00.000Z	97	2010-05-20T00:00:00.000Z	1	1996-11-21T00:00:00.000Z	???????	&#924;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#964;&#940;&#957;	?????	&#1041;&#1091;&#1090;&#1072;&#1085;	Bhoutan	Bhután	Bhutan 	Bhutan	Butão	Bhutan	Bhutan 	null

The country is generally arid savanna, grading into the Kalahari Desert to the west. The Okavango Depression in the northwest is somewhat better wooded and is generally more moist.\r\nMost of the country is dry with hot summers and cold winters; in the desert regions winter temperatures (May-August) can fall below zero at night. Late summer (February-April) is the wettest time of the year, but there is much variability from year to year. Flooding of the Okavango depends greatly on the rainfall in the upper catchment in Angola which may be very different from that in Botswana. Most of the water in the Okavango Delta is lost by evaporation.	11967	Lakes: The main natural lakes of importance are the Ngami, Xau and Liambezi. The Ngami and Xau Lakes form the terminal sumps of the Okavango Delta and are fed mainly by the Boteti River, while the Liambezi Lake is fed by the Chobe River. All three of these lakes used to be highly productive, supporting good fisheries, but in recent years, owing to continued drought, they have all dried up completely. Until it dried up in 1982, Lake Ngami was a very productive lake which supported a rapidly developing fishery yielding over 200 t/yr. According to estimates, this lake has a potential of producing more than 3,000 tons of fish a year. Lake Liambezi did not dry up completely until 1986. Before then, the lake used to support a sizeable fishery which was rapidly developing under a viable cooperative system. Yields as high as 1,000 t/yr have been obtained from this lake, most of which were exported.\r\nRivers, floodplains and swamps: The Okavango and its terminal swamps are the largest aquatic system in the country. The Okavango River enters Botswana and Angola after crossing the Caprivi strip, and almost immediately spreads out into fan-shaped delta swamp. The swamp is endorheic and only has outflow in exceptional years when part of the flow drains into the Zambesi system by way of the Selinda Spillway and the Linyati River, and into the Mababe Depression by way of the Khwai River. The Mababe Depression may also be flooded from the Zambesi River via the Savuti River. Some water also moves down the Boteti River toward the Makgadikgadi Depression, although this has not flooded in recent years. The Limpopo River forms part of the boundary with South Africa. Botswanian territory covers a minute part (4 km) of the Upper Zambesi River channel.	11967	The following information is to be sought:\r\n- Status of knowledge of the freshwater fauna;\r\n- Existence of conservation plans;\r\n- Information on major aquatic habitats or sites within the country;\r\n- Current major threats to species;\r\n- Future potential threats to species;\r\n- Contact(s) for further information.	594	null	null	78	0	4	0	41	0	12	15	33	0	24	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	null	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/bc.html#	null	null	1	1993-11-19T00:00:00.000Z	97	2012-11-21T00:00:00.000Z	null	null	??????????	&#924;&#960;&#959;&#964;&#963;&#959;&#965;&#940;&#957;&#945;	????????	&#1041;&#1086;&#1090;&#1089;&#1074;&#1072;&#1085;&#1072;	Botswana	Botswana	Botswana 	Botswana	Botsuana	Botswana	Botswana 	null

Mountain ranges, most notably the Maya Mountains, dominate the southern half. Victoria Peak, the highest point, is 1,122 m. Coral reefs and numerous cays, or islets, indent the Caribbean coastline to the east.\r\nThe climate of Belize is subtropical, moderated by sea breezes along the coast. The average annual temperature is about 26°C. The rainy season extends from May to February, with the total annual rainfall increasing from north to south and averaging about 1,800 mm.	12263	Principal rivers in Belize are the Belize River, the Río Hondo, which forms much of the border with Mexico, and the Sarstoon River, forming the southern border with Guatemala.	12263	Forty four per cent of Belize is forestland, rich in biological diversity. Less than 2 per cent of its species are officially designated as endangered, and 42% (1998) of the total land area is protected. Belize is the site of the world’s second largest coral reef, which is home to many rich ecosystems. Disturbances have been noted, however, as a result of pollution, tourism, and fishing.

It consists of a double chain of six major islands, some 30 smaller islands and approximately 962 isles, atolls and cays. Many of the islands are of recent volcanic origin. The larger islands are rugged and mountainous with rainforest vegetation while the smallest are bare, coral atolls and sand cays.\r\nCoastal temperatures range from 22°C to an average maximum of 31°C throughout the year. Morning relative humidities regularly reach 90%. The mean annual rainfall generally ranges from 3,000 to 5,000 mm. The north-west monsoon period from November through April brings heavy rain and cyclones.	12336	Rivers and streams are numerous on the larger islands as well as many of the smaller ones.	12336	Logging operations have resulted in some deforestation in the Solomon Islands, although the government has established a 98 km2 tree plantation to counter the effects. Soil erosion is a problem in areas where farming is done on steep slopes and in cleared forest areas. An agreement known as the Wellington Convention has had some success in ensuring that stocks of tuna are not depleted. Pollution of any body of water is prohibited, but enforcement is difficult.\r\n\r\nThe following information is to be sought:\r\n- Status of knowledge of the freshwater fauna;\r\n- Existence of conservation plans;\r\n- Information on major aquatic habitats or sites within the country;\r\n- Current major threats to species;\r\n- Future potential threats to species;\r\n- Contact(s) for further information.	12263	null	null	11	20	2	1	16	0	4	4	5	0	5	0	1	0	0	0	-1	0	692	49	0	7	327	0	26	8	232	0	110	0	0	7	0	4	null	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/bp.html#	#http://www.spc.org.nc/coastfish/Countries/solomons/solomons.htm#	null	1	1993-11-18T00:00:00.000Z	97	2013-01-10T00:00:00.000Z	null	null	????? ?????????	&#925;&#942;&#963;&#959;&#953;&#32;&#931;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#956;&#974;&#957;&#964;&#945;	?????????? ???????	&#1057;&#1086;&#1083;&#1086;&#1084;&#1086;&#1085;&#1086;&#1074;&#1099;&#32;&#1054;&#1089;&#1090;&#1088;&#1086;&#1074;&#1072;	Îles Salomon	Islas Salomón	Solomon Inseln 	Salomonseilanden	Ilhas Salomão	Salomone, Isole 	Salomonöarna	null

Mountain ranges form a continuous barrier along the western border with India and Bangladesh and extend southward parallel with the coast to the Irrawaddy delta. In the north-east, the border with China follows the high crest of the Irrawaddy-Salween divide, then bulges out eastward to enclose the ruggedly mountainous Shan Plateau forming the border with Laos and Thailand.\r\n\r\nBetween these eastern and western mountain barriers lie the fertile, heavily populated plains of the Irrawaddy, with its largest tributary, the Chindwin, joining from the north-west. Myanmar's other great river, the Salween, lies further east. It enters Myanmar from neighbouring Yunnan and flows south, cutting through the Shan Plateau in deep gorges, once heavily forested, before running into the Gulf of Martaban. In the south lies Tenasserim, which extends south to the Kra Isthmus as a long hilly arm.\r\n\r\nTemperatures are very warm throughout the year. Most areas of the country have heavy monsoon rain in summer but are dry in winter.	4832	Myanmar is drained by three major rivers, Salween, Sittang and Irrawaddy, emptying into the Gulf of Bengal. Salween is the largest and longest: its upper reach in Tibet is inhabited by a High Asian fauna; its middle reach in Yunnan, China and its lower one in Myanmar have a Southern Asian fauna. The Sittang and Irrawaddy Rivers are entirely included in the South Asian region. Some tributaries of the Irrawaddy from the Kosi and Naga Hills are close to the Brahmaputra tributaries, and for a few species recorded from these hill areas it is not clear in which river basin they live. The small coastal rivers from the western slope of Peninsular Thailand and the part of Thailand included in the Salween basin share the Myanmar fish fauna.\r\n\r\nThe fauna of the three Myanmar rivers is closely related to that of India. Several Indo-Myanmar genera are better represented in Myanmar: @Acanthocobitis@ has five or six species confined to Myanmar and/or Bengal, a single one of which ranges throughout India. On the contrary, @Salmostoma@ (Cyprinidae) has nine Indian species as against one endemic to Myanmar and another shared by both countries.\r\n\r\nEndemic fish genera are: @Sawbwa@ and @Inlecypris@ in Lake Inle, Salween drainage, @Danionella@ in the Irrawaddy basin, @Microrasbora@, @Neonemacheilus@, @Glaridoglanis@ and @Pseudexostoma@ in the Salween, Irrawaddy and probably also in the Sittang basins. The two former are said to include undescribed species also in the eastern tributaries of the Brahmaputra (Kottelat, 1989; Ref. 12041).	4833	Though the species that occur in Myanmar are treated in Indian publications, available information is superficial and fragmentary (Ref. 12217).\r\n\r\nThe following information is to be sought:\r\n-Existence of conservation plans;\r\n-Current major threats to species;\r\n-Future potential threats to species;\r\n-Contact(s) for further information.\r\n\r\nFreshwater sites of exceptional biodiversity interest are Lake Indawngy and also Lake Inle, the latter with 9 endemic species and 3 endemic genera (Ref. 12217).	12217	12041	12040	414	52	14	13	146	7	49	16	67	0	37	56	19	26	0	3	0	0	411	150	0	4	419	0	38	0	97	0	135	0	0	22	0	3	null	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/bm.html#	null	null	1	1993-11-17T00:00:00.000Z	97	2015-09-10T00:00:00.000Z	1	1996-11-21T00:00:00.000Z	???????	&#924;&#965;&#945;&#957;&#956;&#940;&#961;	?????	&#1041;&#1080;&#1088;&#1084;&#1072;	Myanmar	Myanmar	Myanmar 	Myanmar	Mianmar	Birmania	Myanmar 	null

Most of the country consists of grassy uplands and hills reaching an altitude of 2,600 m. The Ruzizi Valley and the very narrow shores surrounding Lake Tanganyika in the west are somewhat lower in altitude.\r\nAlthough it is situated just south of the equator, the upland temperatures of Burundi are low because of its altitude. The Ruzizi Valley and the shores of Lake Tanganyika are somewhat warmer. There is a short dry season in January; major rains occur from February to May. The major dry season lasts from May to September, and is followed by a second rainy spell.	11967	Lakes: The largest body of water in Burundi is the northeastern corner of Lake Tanganyika. About 2,600 km2 of this lake lie within the boundaries of the country, representing about 8% of its total area. The lake is very deep and the shoreline plunges steeply downward. There are some small lakes (Upper Kagera (also called Akagera) Lakes Complex) in the north of the country associated with the Akanyaru River. Largest of these are Lakes Cyohoha South and Rugwero, which are situated between Burundi and Rwanda. Three smaller lakes (Kazigiri, Lirwihindi and Kakamurindi) complete the series.\r\nRivers, floodplains and swamps: There are no rivers in Burundi of major importance to fisheries. The Ruzizi River, which flows from Lake Kivu toward Lake Tanganyika, is relatively small and swift flowing. In the northern part of the country the tributaries of the Akanyaru River drain toward the Kagera in Rwanda and eventually Lake Victoria in Tanzania. The main rivers are the Ruvubu (130 km in Burundi), the Kagera (border with Rwanda in the north), and the Malagarazi (border with Tanzania in the southeast), i.e., about 400 km in Burundi with a surface area of about 80 km2 (Ministère de l'Agriculture et de l'Elevage/FAO, 1988 (Ref. 12095).\r\nThere are a number of small floodplains and swamps in the north and southeast.	11967	The following information is to be sought:\r\n- Status of knowledge of the freshwater fauna;\r\n- Existence of conservation plans;\r\n- Information on major aquatic habitats or sites within the country;\r\n- Current major threats to species;\r\n- Future potential threats to species;\r\n- Contact(s) for further information.	594	null	null	218	0	4	1	47	1	5	22	115	0	11	5	5	18	0	0	-1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	null	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/by.html#	null	null	1	1993-11-19T00:00:00.000Z	97	2010-05-20T00:00:00.000Z	null	null	??????????	&#924;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#973;&#957;&#964;&#953;	???????	&#1041;&#1091;&#1088;&#1091;&#1085;&#1076;&#1080;	Burundi	Burundi	Burundi 	Burundi	Burundi	Burundi	Burundi 	null

To the north is the Chuor Phnum Dângrêk range.\r\n\r\nCambodia has a tropical monsoon climate, with the average annual temperature about 27°C. The rainy season extends from mid-April to mid-October. The average annual rainfall is about 1,400 millimeters on the central plains, about 3,800 millimeters in mountain regions, and about 5,080 millimeters along the coast.	12263	The Mekong flows from north to south through Cambodia. Tonle Sap (Great Lake) covers an area of about 2,600 square kilometers in the dry season, but as much as 10,400 square kilometers in the rainy season.

Essentially a well-watered plateau, the uplands (circa 1,500 m altitude) serve as a watershed dividing the Chari Basin from that of the Oubangui/Zaire. Most of the country is open savanna tending to become more arid toward the north. There is some rain forest in the extreme southwest and semi-desert in the northeast.\r\nThe climate is fairly consistent over most of the country with rains well dispersed throughout the year. There is, however, a drier period from December through April and a wetter period from May through December.\r\nThe Central African Republic has an entirely agricultural economy with a largely rural population, most of which is concentrated in the south of the country. There are large tracts of wild and uninhabited land.	11967	Lakes: There is one medium-sized lake in the North (Lake Mamoun). Small lakes are abundant on the floodplains of the larger-rivers.\r\nRivers, floodplains and swamps: The Central African Republic is divided into two main watersheds: To the south, there is the Zaire Basin where the Oubangui (together with its headstream, the Mbomou) forms the southern border of the country for over 1,000 km, and is fed by numerous small rivers. The Mambere drains into the Sangha River, which also feeds the Zaire River; To the north, two main blocks of rivers flow toward the Chari River. In the northeast there is the Bahr Aouk and in the northwest the Bamingui and Ouham. Extensive floodplains (circa 30,000 km2) are developed in both blocks.\r\nReservoirs: there are several small dams in the country, some (i.e., Boukoko and Baoro) reaching an area of several hectares.\r\nCoastal lagoons: there are no coastal lagoons; the country is landlocked.	11967	The following information is to be sought:\r\n- Status of knowledge of the freshwater fauna;\r\n- Existence of conservation plans;\r\n- Information on major aquatic habitats or sites within the country;\r\n- Current major threats to species;\r\n- Future potential threats to species;\r\n- Contact(s) for further information.	594	null	null	85	0	6	0	23	3	7	57	10	0	7	6	0	3	0	0	-1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	null	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/ct.html#	null	null	1	1993-11-19T00:00:00.000Z	303	2014-05-01T00:00:00.000Z	null	null	???????? ?????????? ??????????	&#922;&#949;&#957;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#942;&#32;&#913;&#966;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#942;&#32;&#916;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#943;&#945;	????????????????????? ??????????	&#1062;&#1077;&#1085;&#1090;&#1088;&#1072;&#1083;&#1100;&#1085;&#1086;&#1072;&#1092;&#1088;&#1080;&#1082;&#1072;&#1085;&#1089;&#1082;&#1072;&#1103;&#32;&#1056;&#1077;&#1089;&#1087;&#1091;&#1073;&#1083;&#1080;&#1082;&#1072;	Centrafrique	República Centroafricana	Republik Zentralafrika 	Centraal-Afrikaanse Republiek	República Centro-Africana	Repubblica Centrafricana	Centralafrikanska republiken	null

Sri Lanka is a tropical island situated at the tip of southern India, separated from the mainland by the Palk Strait, which is less than 20 km wide in places. Frequent and prolonged connections have occurred between the two land masses in the past. The central area is mountainous with 103 river basins radiating from this area. Less than half of these rivers are perennial. Sri Lanka has no natural lakes but about 2% of the land surface is covered by several thousand irrigation reservoirs. Most of the island is dry and dependent for water on the north-east monsoon from November to February. The south-west quarter of the island, known as the wet zone, receives an additional monsoon from May to September.	11966	The endemic fishes of the island are, by and large, restricted to the wet zone.  This is attributed to the wet zone being a land-island biotope. The wet zone can be divided into two provinces: firstly the more or less contiguous southwest-flowing drainages of the Kelani, Kalu, Gin and Nilwala Rivers; and secondly the land-island province formed by the Knuckle Hills within the northeast-flowing Mahaweli River drainage. The remaining dry zone province of the island contains mostly fish species also shared with India and the wet zone.	11966	Knowledge of the status of freshwater fishes in Sri Lanka is very good. The most recent assessment of threats and conservation issues was in 1994 (Pethiyagoda, 1994; Ref. 11966). A full list of Sri Lankan fishes was published in 1991 (Pethiyagoda, 1991, Ref. 6028).\r\n\r\nThe overall conservation status of  Sri Lanka’s freshwater fish fauna is poor. The wet zone species are threatened mainly by deforestation and its consequences, while those in the dry zone appear to be subject to increasing competition from exotics and fishery pressure. Fishes in both zones are threatened by increasing use of pesticides . All nine recently-discovered species have very small distributions and are therefore under threat from minor local disturbances. Although it is likely that several other species await discovery, the rate of increase of pressure on this fauna is so high that extinctions are expected.  In the long-term the threat to the fauna is severe. None of the native fishes and fish assemblages enjoy protection. None of the species with restricted distributions are located in protected areas.\r\n\r\nContact: Rohan Pethiyagoda, Wildlife Heritage Trust, 95 Cotta Road, Colombo 8, SRI LANKA.	6028	12217	4832	92	46	21	46	44	6	30	62	21	6	16	20	3	11	0	0	0	0	757	160	0	58	622	1	49	144	134	2	177	3	1	27	0	6	null	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/ce.html#	null	null	1	1993-11-18T00:00:00.000Z	10	2010-05-20T00:00:00.000Z	null	null	??? ?????	&#931;&#961;&#953;&#32;&#923;&#940;&#957;&#954;&#945;	??? ?????	&#1064;&#1088;&#1080;&#32;&#1051;&#1072;&#1085;&#1082;&#1072;	Sri Lanka	Sri Lanka	Sri Lanka 	Sri Lanka	Sri Lanca	Sri Lanka	Sri Lanka 	null

Sara and Sango (in south) (Ref. 43072).	Chad is a landlocked country, shaped like a shallow basin cut in half and has a surface area of 1,284,000 sq. km.  Lake Chad itself lies at the bottom with an altitude of 280 m. The land rises to the north (where the Tibesti Mountains reach altitudes as high as 3,400 m), to the east to the highlands of Sudan, and to the south to the Chari watershed. The southwest of the country is heavily wooded, but the country rapidly becomes desertic toward the north.\r\nMost of the southern Chad has a prolonged rainy season; heavy rains last from April through October. Nearer the centre of the country the season becomes shorter (June-September), and north of Lake Chad there is little rainfall.\r\nThe south of Chad has an agrarian population, living mainly on subsistence agriculture. The north is desert and inhabited only by nomadic tribes. The Sahelian transitional savanna is used mainly by pastoral people for grazing cattle, sheep and goats.	11969	Lakes: Lake Chad fluctuates in area in a pronounced cycle thought to be some 25 years long. This lake exists in two phases: the Greater Chad in pluvial periods, and the Lesser Chad in drought. During its Greater Chad phase, half of the lake's 22,000 sq. km. lies within the country. In its more recent (1978) diminished state, about 1,200 sq. km. of the remaining 2,000 sq. km. of open water were left around the mouth of the Chari River. Apart from Lake Chad itself, there are several smaller lakes.

The Tarim Basin has the vast, sandy Takla Makan Desert, the driest desert in Asia. Dunes in its interior rise to elevations of about 100 meters. The Turpan Pendi, the largest area in China with elevations below sea level, commands the southern entrance of a major pass through the Tian Shan. The Junggar Pendi is primarily a region of fertile steppe soils supporting irrigated agriculture, although it contains some areas of sandy and stony desert.\r\nThe Mongolian Borderlands: Located in north central China, this is a plateau region of mainly sandy, stony, or gravel deserts that grade eastwards into steppe lands with fertile soils. The flat to rolling plains are partitioned by several barren, flat-topped mountain ranges. Along the eastern border is the higher, forested Da Hinggan Ling (Hinggan Mountains).\r\nThe Northeast: Comprising all of Manchuria east of the Da Hinggan Ling, the Northeast region incorporates the Manchurian Plain and its bordering uplands. The plain has extensive tracts of productive soils, and the uplands are hilly to mountainous, with numerous broad valleys and gentle slopes. The Liaodong Bandao (Liaodong Peninsula) extending to the south, is noteworthy for its good natural harbours.\r\nNorth China: This region lies between the Mongolian Borderlands on the north and the Yangzi River Basin on the south and consists of several distinct topographic units. The Huangtu Gaoyuan on the northwest is formed by the accumulation of loess. The loosely packed loess is readily subject to erosion, and the plateau’s surface is transected by sunken roads, vertical-walled valleys, and numerous gullies. The region is extensively terraced and cultivated. The Huabei Pingyuan, the largest flat lowland area in China, consists of fertile soils derived from loess. Most of the plain is under intense cultivation. To the east, the Shandong Qiuling (Shandong Highlands) on the Shandong Bandao (Shandong Peninsula) consist of two distinct areas of mountains flanked by rolling hills. The rocky coast of the peninsula provides some good natural harbours. To the southwest are the Central Mountains, which constitute a formidable barrier to north-south movement.\r\nSouth China: This region embraces the Yangzi Gorges and the topographically diverse regions to the south. The Yangzi Gorges consist of a series of basins with fertile alluvial soils. These lowlands are criss-crossed with waterways, both natural and artificial, and dotted with lakes. The Sichuan Basin, located to the west, is enclosed by rugged mountain spurs of the Central Highlands and constitutes a relatively isolated area of hilly terrain. The area is known for its intensive terrace farming. The highlands of South China extend from the Tibetan Plateau east to the sea. In the west, the deeply eroded Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau is bordered by a series of mountain ranges separated by deep, steep-walled gorges. One of the world’s most scenic landscapes is found in eastern Guizhou Province, where the terrain is dominated by tall limestone pinnacles and pillar-like peaks. To the east are the largely deforested and severely eroded Nan Ling hills, and along the coast are the rugged Southeastern Highlands, where bays with numerous offshore islands provide good natural harbours. Lying south of the Nan Ling hills is the Xi Jiang Basin, predominantly a hilly area with infertile soils; the numerous streams of this region, however, are bordered by fertile, flat-floored alluvial valleys. The broad delta plain of the Zhu Jiang (Pearl River) is commonly called the Canton delta.\r\nThe Tibetan Plateau: The high, mountain-rimmed plateau of Tibet occupies the remote southwestern extremity of China. The world’s highest plateau region, Tibet has an average elevation of about 4,877 meters above sea level. Bordering ranges include the Himalayas on the south, the Pamirs and Karakorum on the west, and the Kunlun and Qilian Shan on the north. The surface of the plateau is dotted with salt lakes and marshes, is crossed by several mountain ranges, and also contains the headwaters of many major rivers of southern and eastern Asia, including those of the Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra, Mekong, Yangzi, and Huang He (Yellow River). The landscape is bleak, barren, and strewn with rocks.\r\n\r\nThe Asian monsoon exerts the primary control on China’s climate. In winter, cold, dry winds blow out of the high-pressure system of central Siberia, bringing low temperatures to all regions north of the Yangzi River and drought to most of the country. In summer, warm, moist air flows inland from the Pacific Ocean, producing rainfall in the form of cyclones. There is much less rain further from the sea and on leeward sides of mountains. The remote basins of the northwest receive little precipitation. Summer temperatures are remarkably uniform throughout most of the country, but winters are characterized by extreme variations in temperature between north and south. Southeastern China, from the Yangzi Gorges southwards, has a subtropical climate that becomes distinctly tropical in the extreme south. Summer temperatures in this region average 26°C. Average winter temperatures decline from 18°C in the tropical south to about 4°C along the Yangzi River. An average of eight typhoons a year, mainly between July and November, bring high winds and heavy rains to the coastal areas. The mountainous plateaus and basins to the southwest also have subtropical climates, with considerable local variation. As a result of higher elevations, summers are cooler, and as a consequence of protection from northerly winds, winters are mild. The Sichuan Basin, which has an 11-month growing season, is noted for high humidity and cloudiness. Rainfall, especially abundant in summer, exceeds 990 millimeters annually in nearly all parts of southern China. North China, which has no mountain ranges to form a protective barrier against the flow of air from Siberia, experiences cold, dry winters. January temperatures range from 4°C in the extreme south to about -10°C north of Beijing and in the higher elevations to the west. July temperatures generally exceed 26°C and, in the Huabei Pingyuan, approach 30°C. Almost all the annual rainfall occurs in summer. Annual precipitation totals are less than 760 millimeters and decrease to the northwest, which has a drier, steppe climate. Year-to-year variability of precipitation in these areas is great; this factor, combined with the possibility of dust storms or hail, makes agriculture precarious. Fog occurs on more than 40 days a year in the east and on more than 80 days along the coast.The climate of Manchuria is similar to, but colder than, that of North China. January temperatures average -18°C over much of the Manchurian Plain, and July temperatures generally exceed 22°C. Rainfall, concentrated in summer, averages about 510 to 760 millimeters in the east but declines to about 300 millimeters  west of the Da Hinggan Ling. Desert and steppe climates prevail in the Mongolian Borderlands and the northwest. January temperatures average below -10°C everywhere except in the Tarim Basin. July temperatures generally exceed 20°C. Annual rainfall totals less than 250 millimeters, and most of the area receives less than 100 millimeters. Because of its high elevation, the Tibetan Plateau has an arctic climate; July temperatures remain below 15°C. The air is clear and dry throughout the year, with annual precipitation totals of less than 100 millimeters everywhere except in the extreme southeast.	12263	The three longest river systems in China are the Yangzi, Huang He, and Xi Jiang, all of which flow in a generally west to east direction to the Pacific Ocean. About 50 per cent of the total land area of China drains to the Pacific. Ten per cent drains to the Indian and Arctic oceans. The remaining 40 per cent have no outlet to the sea and drain to the arid basins of the west and north, where the streams either evaporate or percolate to form deep underground water reserves. The Tarim He is principal among these streams.The northernmost major stream of China is the Amur, which forms most of the northeastern border with Russia. The major river of North China is the Huang He, called "China’s Sorrow" because of its devastating flooding throughout history. The Yangzi River of central China is the longest river in Asia. A major transport artery, the Yangzi rises near the source of the Huang He, has a vast drainage basin, and enters the sea at Shanghai. The most important river system of southern China is the Xi Jiang. Most of the important lakes of China are situated along the middle and lower Yangzi Gorges. The two largest in the middle section are Dongting Hu and Poyang Hu. In summer, they increase their area by two to three times, serving as reservoirs for excess water. The Tibetan Plateau contains many large saline lakes. The largest of these is the marshy Qinghai Hu.\r\n\r\nFreshwater sites of exceptional biodiversity interest are the Wuhan lakes, Dongtin Lake, and Yunnan lakes.	12217	China, with a large and expanding population and a remarkable record of economic growth, has the potential to affect the global environment as well as the ecosystems within its borders. Water shortages throughout the country, especially in urban areas, may become an even more serious issue as future growth in water usage threatens to outpace supplies. Most of the nation’s rivers, especially in urban areas, are seriously polluted. A wastewater discharge permit system is being implemented, however, along with a pollution levy system by which polluters pay the cost of cleanup. About 14 per cent (1993) of the total land area in China is forest and woodland, but deforestation is threatening the habitats of many of the thousands of species that dwell there, some of them unique to China. There has also been a rapid increase in the amount of desert land, and soil erosion is a serious problem taking a toll on agriculture production. Efforts are under way to improve the situation, however. Reforestation programs are being undertaken, a large proportion of which are also aimed at providing fuelwood. Sand-break forests have been built to combat desertification.To preserve animal habitat, the Chinese government has set up 400 nationally protected areas covering 3 per cent of the total land area, and it has signed a number of international agreements relating to conservation.\r\n\r\nTwo recent synopses of Chinese freshwater species cover 800 and 1010 species, respectively. Several works deal with the fauna of provinces, basins, or islands. All of these works are in Chinese and not easily available.

East of this central chain the land is hilly, terminating in precipitous cliffs that rise from the ocean to heights of about 760 meters. To the west, a broad, fertile plain slopes gently down to the shallow Taiwan Strait. With the exception of this plain, the average elevation of Taiwan is about 1,220 meters.\r\n\r\nThe warm, humid Taiwanese summer extends from May to September; temperatures average about 28°C. The mild winter season lasts from December to February; January temperatures average about 18°C. Typhoons occur between June and October. Average annual precipitation is about 2,540 millimeters.	12263	null	12263	Rapid industrialization over the past three decades has severely degraded Taiwan’s environment. One of the world’s top users of fertilizers and pesticides, Taiwan has polluted virtually all of its rivers. Half of the nation’s drinking water is contaminated from farm wastes, and less than 4 per cent of all sewage is treated, leaving the country with the world’s second highest rate of hepatitis B. To begin to reduce the environmental destruction, Taiwan plans to use some of its export wealth to invest in pollution-control technologies. Taiwan also draws heavy criticism for its continued importation of endangered species.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of good publications on Taiwan's marine and freshwater fishes (in Chinese). \r\n\r\nThe following information is to be sought:\r\n\r\n- Existence of conservation plans;\r\n- Future potential threats to species;\r\n- Contact(s) for further information.	12263	null	null	80	53	37	33	55	39	15	45	23	1	22	9	3	7	5	0	0	-1	2344	300	2	107	1097	61	35	650	471	1	269	2	8	42	0	12	The Fish Database of Taiwan	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/tw.html#	null	null	1	1993-11-19T00:00:00.000Z	303	2014-05-01T00:00:00.000Z	1	1996-11-25T00:00:00.000Z	??????	&#932;&#945;&#970;&#946;&#940;&#957;	???????	&#1058;&#1072;&#1081;&#1074;&#1072;&#1085;&#1100;	Taïwan	Taiwan	Taiwan 	Taiwan	Taiwan	Taiwan	Taiwan 	null

It is approximately 290 km south of Java and 850 km northeast of the Cocos Islands. It is about 22 km in its greatest length (straight-line distance between Egeria Point and North East Point), with the overall shape resembling a dog with its head facing towards the east.\r\n\r\nTotal area is 135 sq km; land: 135 sq km, water: 0 sq km (Ref. 30539).  \r\n\r\nThe coastline is extremely irregular consisting primarily of sheer rocky cliffs which on the average are 10-20 m in height. At many localities on the north coast the coastal cliffs plunge vertically (where they are sometimes undercut) and then continue for another 2-5 m below the surface. These cliffs are composed of highly eroded limestone and contain many interesting caverns and ledges which extend below the surface. Most of the beaches (10-12 in number) are nothing more than narrow strips of sand which are exposed only at low tide.\r\n\r\nInland, the island rises steeply with an initial series of coastal terraces. Most of the interior consists of relatively gentle sloping hills with a maximum elevation of about 361 m above sea level. The island is covered everywhere, except on the steep cliffs and where phosphate mining has occurred (phosphate being a major natural resource, Ref. 30539), by a dense canopy of tropical jungle.   \r\n\r\nChristmas Island  has tropical climate; heat and humidity moderated by trade winds (Ref. 30539).	30874	Most of the submarine coast around Christmas Island consists of a relatively narrow shelf of coral reef varying in width from about 20 to 100 m. In Flying Fish Cove there is a well-developed fringing reef in shallow water adjacent to the shore, which is sometimes exposed during low tide. This shallow reef extends for about 20-50 m before plunging abruptly to a depth of 3-5 m, and then there is a gradual descent to the upper edge of the outer reef slope. The outer, seaward slope plunges quickly to deep water around the entire coastline.\r\n\r\nAn extensive elevated terrace, about 3-4 m in width and perched about 2-3 m above mean sea level, is present at North West , Egeria and Steep Points. The terrace contains a number of large pools with depths of 0.2-1 m and harbours a rich collection of fishes. \r\n\r\nThere are no brackish estuaries, silty bays and protected lagoon environments.\r\n\r\nAlthough an abundance of subterranean water is present, there is very little suitable habitat to support fish life. It consists mainly of a few springs and very small, gradient creeks.	30874	The marine fish fauna is well known and consists primarily of reef-associated species. It may be best described as a slightly impoverished Indo-Malayan one. This impoverishment is primarily due to the oceanic position of the island, its small size and the consequent low diversity of habitat.      \r\n\r\nFreshwater fishes of Christmas Island are few. Those most commonly encountered are introduced exotics which include members of the genus <i>Gambusia</i>, <i>Xiphophorus</i>, <i>Poecilia</i> and <i>Sarotherodon</i>.  The only known native species include a freshwater eel (<i> Anguilla</i> sp.) taken from a shallow stream at Dolly Beach, a small brown fish in Lost Lake Cave, and the freshwater gudgeon <i>Eleotris fusca</i>.\r\n\r\nPresently, the relatively small population of the island and the current low level of exploitation of its reef resources minimize the need for detailed conservation measures. However, this will change as phosphate mining declines and the development of tourism proceeds is anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe following information is to be sought:\r\n- Contact(s) for further information.	30874	null	null	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	583	4	0	0	294	0	13	0	296	79	22	0	0	6	0	2	null	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/kt.html#	null	null	1	1993-11-19T00:00:00.000Z	303	2014-05-01T00:00:00.000Z	null	null	????? ?????????????

The dry season lasts from June to September. Temperatures are even, but reach a minimum during the dry period.	11967	Lakes: there are several minor lakes associated with river floodplains (i.e., Lakes Tele, Cayo, Dinga, Nanga). Brazzaville is located on Pool Malebo (Stanley Pool), a lake-like enlargement of the Zaire/Congo River.\r\nRivers, floodplains and swamps: the Zaire/Congo River forms the frontier between Zaire and Congo for over 500 km2 of its lower course. The frontier continues for a further 500 km up the Ubangui. The hinterland of these rivers forms a vast marshland (the Cuvette Congolaise) with extensive savanna floodplains and permanently flooded gallery forests. The are which covers about 30 - 45,000 km2 is drained by the River Sangha, the Likouala and Likouala-aux-Herbes as well as by numerous smaller rivers. Of several smaller coastal rivers, the Kouilou is the largest.\r\nReservoirs: there is one impoundment on the Bouenza (tributary of Kouilou) at Moukoukoulou and a second is planned at Sounda on the Kouilou.\r\nCoastal lagoons: there are three small lagoons: Conkouati, Loubi and Malonda.	11967	The following information is to be sought:\r\n- Status of knowledge of the freshwater fauna;\r\n- Existence of conservation plans;\r\n- Information on major aquatic habitats or sites within the country;\r\n- Current major threats to species;\r\n- Future potential threats to species;\r\n- Contact(s) for further information.	594	null	null	302	23	11	0	44	2	13	153	45	0	15	14	16	5	0	2	-1	0	363	70	0	4	261	0	4	1	15	0	89	0	4	19	0	3	null	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/cf.html#	null	null	1	1993-11-17T00:00:00.000Z	303	2010-05-20T00:00:00.000Z	null	null	?????? ??????????	&#922;&#959;&#957;&#947;&#954;&#972;&#32;&#916;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#943;&#945;	?????, ??????????????? ??????????	&#1050;&#1086;&#1085;&#1075;&#1086;&#44;&#32;&#1044;&#1077;&#1084;&#1086;&#1082;&#1088;&#1072;&#1090;&#1080;&#1095;&#1077;&#1089;&#1082;&#1072;&#1103;&#32;&#1056;&#1077;&#1089;&#1087;&#1091;&#1073;&#1083;&#1080;&#1082;&#1072;	Congo (République du)	Congo	Der Kongo, Republik von 	Republiek Congo	Congo-Brazzaville	Congo	Kongo-Brazzaville	null

Rep. consists mainly of a low-lying central basin covered by tropical rain forest. The basin is surrounded by mountainous terraces in the west, elevated plateaus covered with savanna in the south and southeast, and dense grasslands in the north. The eastern region is crossed by high mountains.\r\nCongo Dem. Rep. lies astride the Equator, about one-third to the north and two-thirds to the south. The climate, therefore, is equatorial and especially hot and humid in the forested central areas. North of the Equator there is a single rainy season from April to November; south of it a rainy season lasts from October to May. In the central region rainfall is distributed evenly throughout the year.	11967	Lakes: the major lakes within the country are those of the Rift Valley and are found in the extreme east of the country (Tanganyika, Mweru, Kivu, Edward and Albert). In addition to these lakes, there are two major water bodies attached to the lower reaches of the river system: Lake Tumba and Lake Maji Ndombe (2,300 km2). The Kamulondo Depression (Lualaba floodplain) contains some 50 lakes, of which Lake Upemba is by far the largest. Numerous small lakes are scattered throughout the country. The combined lake surface area is circa 28,000 km2.\r\nRivers, floodplains and swamps: with the exception of parts of the Ubangi system and the upper reaches of some of the southern tributaries, almost the whole of the Congo River basin lies within the country. The main channel of the Congo is joined by such major tributaries as the Ubangi, Lualaba, Luapula, Lulonga, Tshuapa. There is a total of some 33,000 km of major river channel and their area (circa 34,000 km2) is increased by intensive floodplains, particularly in the Kamulondo Depression and in the Mbandaka region of confluence between the Ubangi and the Congo streams. In total, the floodplains are thought to cover about 50,000 km2 during high water, but such a figure can only be approximate due to the difficulties in measuring such areas.\r\nReservoirs: two major reservoirs have been installed in the southeast of the country: Mwadingusha on the Lufira, and Nzilo on the Lualaba.\r\nCoastal lagoons: none of significant size.	11967	The following information is to be sought:\r\n- Status of knowledge of the freshwater fauna;\r\n- Existence of conservation plans;\r\n- Information on major aquatic habitats or sites within the country;\r\n- Current major threats to species;\r\n- Future potential threats to species;\r\n- Contact(s) for further information.	594	null	null	1048	28	7	5	122	1	18	485	181	1	35	191	101	19	0	2	-1	0	312	71	0	1	226	0	3	14	11	0	79	0	0	18	0	4	null	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/cg.html#	null	null	1	1993-11-17T00:00:00.000Z	303	2010-05-20T00:00:00.000Z	null	null	??????, ????? ??????????	&#922;&#959;&#957;&#947;&#954;&#972;&#44;&#32;&#923;&#945;&#970;&#954;&#942;&#32;&#916;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#943;&#945;	?????, ??????????	&#1050;&#1086;&#1085;&#1075;&#1086;&#44;&#32;&#1056;&#1077;&#1089;&#1087;&#1091;&#1073;&#1083;&#1080;&#1082;&#1072;	Congo (République Démocratique du)	Zaire	Kongo, Dem.

A paper on the status of freshwater fish in Croatian Adriatic river systems was published in 1995 (Mrakovcic et al., 1995).\r\n\r\nThere are two large river systems within Croatia, the Danube and Adriatic systems. These are divided by the Dinarid Alps , extending as far as Prkletje Mountain. The Adriatic catchment can be divided into three regions: 1. the Istrian Peninsula; 2. the Croatian maritime region; and 3. the karstic region (Krska polja) with valleys and underground streams in the inland Adriatic basin. The Istrian Peninsula has two main large rivers, the Rasa and Mirna. Rivers in this region are quite polluted. Rivers of the Croatian maritime region include the Rijecina which is extremely polluted in its lower reaches. The Zrmanja River is the only large river in this area, with a length of 69 km. There is already one hydroelectric plant on this river and more are planned. The Krka River, running through limestone areas, is a site of great natural beauty and importance. The Cetina River is characterised by its abundance of water and underground connection with the Bosnian karstic region. It has five hydroelectric plants along its length and two more are planned. The Krska polja area is a special region that is connected by an underground hydrographic network of rivers. Flood waters in valleys in this area have been controlled, completely changing the hydrological conditions. Intensive agriculture involving the use of fertilisers and pesticides has also worsened the water quality of this region. Near Ravni Kotari is Lake Vrana, an oligotrophic 3000 ha reservoir, artificially connected to the sea. It is inhabited mainly by species introduced from the Danube basin.\r\n\r\nMajor threats to species within Croatia come from pollution, river regulation and the construction of hydroelectric and water supply reservoirs. In the Adriatic area there are 12 new hydroelectric plants and 12 are planned. Cold water and cave fish are those most likely to suffer from such activities.\r\n\r\nThe fish fauna of all Croatian Mediterranean rivers has been poorly researched. It is important to list all important habitats and species. One of the large rivers, the Krka, should be left in its natural condition. Small streams and wells in the karstic region and their fish fauna should be recorded. It is possible that some endemic species remain to be recorded in this area. At present there is no list of endangered species in Croatia. Amongst the most endangered species of the Adriatic catchment are all species of the genera Paraphoxinus and Salmothymus, plus the species Leuciscus polylepis and Aulopyge hugeli. \r\n\r\nContact: Milorad Mrakovcic, Fisheries Centre, Kneza Mislava 2/V, 41000 Zagreb, CROATIA; Stjepan Misetic, Elekroprojekt, Vukovarska avenija 37, 41000 Zagreb, CROATIA; Meta Povz, Institute for Fisheries, Zupanciceva 9, 61000 Ljubljana, SLOVENIA.	null	null	null	84	12	13	1	47	5	20	1	12	0	33	9	3	37	1	26	0	0	240	53	3	3	208	2	17	0	30	0	107	0	0	29	0	11	null	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/hr.html#	null	null	1	1993-11-22T00:00:00.000Z	97	2014-08-01T00:00:00.000Z	null	null	???????	&#922;&#961;&#959;&#945;&#964;&#943;&#945;	????????	&#1061;&#1086;&#1088;&#1074;&#1072;&#1090;&#1080;&#1103;	Croatie	Croacia	Kroatien 	Kroatië	Croácia	Croazia	Kroatien 	null

There are two rainy seasons, a major rain from March to June, and a minor one peaking in October. In the north the country becomes more arid, with a cool period in December and January and a hot period between March and June. Rainfall is concentrated into one season between July and October.\r\nBenin is an agricultural country. The south concentrates on plantations of oil palm; to the north the main crops are maize and cotton. Cattle are abundant, particularly on the floodplains of the Niger in the north and the Ouèmè in the south. There is a considerable amount of drawdown agriculture on the floodplains in the south and rice cultivation has been introduced recently in the Ouèmè.	11967	Lakes: Benin has over 330 sq. km. surface area of lakes and lagoons. There are several groups of lakes associated with the floodplains of the south-flowing rivers. On the Ouèmè there are Lakes Azilli and Cele and on the Mono there are about six lakes, but siltation and other changes due to management of this basin are altering their characteristics very rapidly.\r\nRivers, floodplains and swamps: hydrologically the country can be divided into five main drainage areas:\r\n(a) to the north Benin borders on the Niger River for about 120 km and the three main mid-course tributaries of that river (the Alibori, Sota and Mekrou Rivers) arise on the central plateau of Benin to flow torrentially northward into the Niger. The Benin bank of the Niger has a broad floodplain covering about 275 sq. km. at peak floods;\r\n(b) the Pendjari River, a tributary of the Volta, drains the western slopes of the Atakora mountains and runs for some 400 km through Benin before entering togo.\r\nThe south-flowing rivers:\r\n(c) the Mono (360 sq. km.);\r\n(d) the Couffo (240 km), and\r\n(e) the Ouèmè (700 km), arise on the central plateau and, below torrential upper courses, form broad fertile floodplains in the coastal zone. The floodplains terminate in a series of extensive lagoons. The greatest of the floodplains, that of the Ouèmè, extends over 2,000 sq. km. at peak floods.\r\nReservoirs: given the seasonal drought, several dams had to be built for water storage. At present, however, there are no major reservoirs in the country, although there are several small cattle dams in the north.\r\nCoastal lagoons: by far the most important bodies of water in the country are the brackish water coastal lagoons which are contiguous with the whole lagoon system of the West African coast. There are two major lagoons: Nokoue and Porto Novo which together cover about 147 sq. km. and are separated only by the numerous channels of the deltaic fan of the Oueme River; and Aheme Lagoon, which covers 85 sq. km. Smaller lagoon systems covering about 28 sq. km. connect the major bodies of water with the sea, and run parallel to the coast behind the dune systems.	11967	The following information is to be sought:\r\n- Status of knowledge of the freshwater fauna;\r\n- Existence of conservation plans;\r\n- Information on major aquatic habitats or sites within the country;\r\n- Current major threats to species;\r\n- Future potential threats to species;\r\n- Contact(s) for further information.	594	null	null	127	22	1	1	59	0	16	21	35	0	20	0	0	4	0	1	-1	0	379	77	0	3	263	0	5	1	17	0	89	0	0	19	0	6	null	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/bn.html#	null	null	1	1993-11-17T00:00:00.000Z	97	2010-05-20T00:00:00.000Z	null	null	??????	&#924;&#960;&#949;&#957;&#943;&#957;	?????	&#1041;&#1077;&#1085;&#1080;&#1085;	Bénin	Benin	Benin 	Benin	Benim	Benin	Benin 	null

The Atlantic Ocean borders the country on the north; the Mona Passage on the east separates it from Puerto Rico; the Caribbean Sea forms its southern border; and Haiti is on the west, sharing about 315 kilometres (about 195 miles) of borderland. A number of adjacent islands, Isla Beata and Isla Saona, for example, are possessions of the Dominican Republic.\r\nThe Dominican Republic is a fertile, well-watered, mountainous country. About 80 per cent of it is covered with a series of massive mountain ranges, extending from northwest to southeast. Between the Cordillera Central and the Cordillera Septentrional, a parallel range to the north, is the Valle del Cibao, one of the most fertile and best-watered areas of the country.\r\n\r\nThe Dominican Republic has a subtropical climate, tempered by the prevailing easterly winds. Temperatures of more than 23°C are registered in the lowlands throughout the year. During the summer months, temperatures range between 27° and 35°C in these regions. The highlands are considerably cooler. Annual precipitation averages about 1,525 mm, but there is considerably more moisture in the mountainous areas of the north. The wet season is from June to November. There are occasional tropical hurricanes.	12263	Among important rivers are the Río Yaque del Norte, Río Yuma, and Río Camú in the north and the Río Yaque del Sur, Río Ozama and Río Soco in the south. The principal lake is the saltwater Lake Enriquillo, about 43 km long.\r\n\r\n\r\n© 1988-1996 Microsoft and/or its suppliers.

The rate of deforestation is quite high and is made more serious because most of it occurs in primary forest areas. The loss of trees has caused erosion and siltation of surrounding coral reefs. More than 22 per cent (1992) of the land area is officially protected in some way.\r\n\r\nThe following information is to be sought:\r\n- Status of knowledge of the freshwater fauna;\r\n- Existence of conservation plans;\r\n- Information on major aquatic habitats or sites within the country;\r\n- Current major threats to species;\r\n- Future potential threats to species;\r\n- Contact(s) for further information.	12263	null	null	22	14	16	2	28	6	12	1	13	0	14	8	2	1	0	0	-1	0	424	58	0	29	285	2	13	1	157	0	107	0	0	14	0	3	null	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/dr.html#	http://www.cep.unep.org/rep_dom/Rep_Dom.htm#SEA-PESQUEROS	null	1	1993-11-17T00:00:00.000Z	97	2010-05-20T00:00:00.000Z	null	null	?????????? ??????????	&#916;&#959;&#956;&#953;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#957;&#942;&#32;&#916;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#943;&#945;	????????????? ??????????	&#1044;&#1086;&#1084;&#1080;&#1085;&#1080;&#1082;&#1072;&#1085;&#1089;&#1082;&#1072;&#1103;&#32;&#1056;&#1077;&#1089;&#1087;&#1091;&#1073;&#1083;&#1080;&#1082;&#1072;	République dominicaine	República Dominicana	Dominikanische Republik 	Dominicaanse Republiek	República Dominicana	Dominicana, Repubblica 	Dominikanska republiken	null

Rio Muni is mainly a fluvial mainland plateau. The islands are of volcanic origin. Most of the country is covered by tropical rainforest.\r\nThe climate is tropical, alternating wet and dry seaons.	11968	Lakes: there are three small volcanic crater lakes on Bioko Island.\r\nRivers, floodplains and swamps: there are no large rivers in the country. The biggest river, Rio Benito (about 230 km long) traverses the middle fo the mainland province of Rio Muni and has an average width of some 150 m. It is not navigable, being cut by frequent rapids, waterfalls and also obstructed by tree trunks. Other rivers have similar physiography and all typically have acid, fairly clean, "black" waters of low pH (4.0 - 6.5), low in nutrient salts and dissolved oxygen, high in humic acids, resulting in low productivity, certainly no more than 25 kg/ha/yr for fish.\r\nReservoirs: there are no significant impoundments.\r\nA hydroelectric project at Bikoma (18 km from Bata) on this river will create a small reservoir of 7-10 ha, but fishing will be difficult there are no bush clearing will be carried out.\r\nCoastal lagoons: there are three large estuarine (Rio Campo, Rio Benito and Rio Munior Utamboni) with brackish, also acidic, water and fairly extensive mangroves (especially in Rio Muni). These appear to be nursery grounds for many marine fish species, as well as crustacea (prawns).	11968	The following information is to be sought:\r\n- Status of knowledge of the freshwater fauna;\r\n- Existence of conservation plans;\r\n- Information on major aquatic habitats or sites within the country;\r\n- Current major threats to species;\r\n- Future potential threats to species;\r\n- Contact(s) for further information.	594	null	null	67	22	0	0	16	0	4	29	15	0	6	3	3	1	0	1	-1	0	392	65	0	1	253	0	5	1	19	0	85	0	1	19	0	4	null	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/ek.html#	null	null	1	1993-11-17T00:00:00.000Z	97	2010-05-20T00:00:00.000Z	null	null	????????? ???????	&#921;&#963;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#957;&#942;&#32;&#915;&#959;&#965;&#970;&#957;&#941;&#945;	?????????????? ??????	&#1069;&#1082;&#1074;&#1072;&#1090;&#1086;&#1088;&#1080;&#1072;&#1083;&#1100;&#1085;&#1072;&#1103;&#32;&#1043;&#1074;&#1080;&#1085;&#1077;&#1103;	Guinée Équatoriale	Guinea Ecuatorial	Äquatorial Guinea	Equatoriaal-Guinea	Guiné Equatorial	Guinea Equatoriale	Ekvatorialguinea	null

More than 60 percent of the country lies above 1,000 m, with extensive plains over 2,000 m. Elevations range from 120 m below sea level in the Dallol Depression (Kobar Sink), south of Massawa, to over 4,620 m in Mount Ras Dushon, north of Lake Tana. In all, ten mountain peaks of the plateau region rise over 4,000 m. A great deal of the terrain is mountainous, rugged and deeply dissected by rivers. The southern half is bisected by the northern arm of the Rift Valley and ranges from 40 to 60 km in width, with escarpments 1,000 - 1,500 m high. The floor of the valley is occupied by a large number of lakes and the rift line forms the main river watershed.\r\nThe plateaux to the west of the rift system form the Central Highlands (2,000 - 2,500 m). To the east are the lower range of the Bale and Havar plateaux. The north-eastern part of the Rift Valley opens out into a delta-shaped plain, in the northern part of which lies the Dallol Depression, an area of 5,000 sq. km. below sea level. The Darcalli range separates these lower plains from the Red Sea. Only in a narrow coastal zone are there lowland areas below 200 m.\r\nThe climate is generally temperate on the plateau, but becomes hot and arid on the lowlands, and is desertic in the northeast and the south. On the plateau, there is a short wet season from February to April, and a major rainy season from June to September.\r\nEthiopia is an entirely agricultural country, where intensive use of marginal lands has often caused severe erosion. Rivers are consequently highly silted. There has been little development for irrigation except along the Awash River.	11969	Aubray (1975) (Ref. 12121) reports that 173,000 sq. km. (14%) of Ethiopia consists of swamp (4%), lakes (1%), rivers and floodplains (9%). This is much higher than the figures given by FAO (1984) (Ref. 12120) for wetland (0.7%, 9,200 sq. km.) and water body (0.5%, 6,700 sq. km.) areas.\r\nLakes: the total lake area in Ethiopia was estimated as 7,500 sq. km. by Aubray (1975) (Ref. 12121), but the statistics listed in Table 1 show that this area may be as much as 8,800 sq. km.\r\nEthiopia is moderately well supplied with natural lakes. Lake Tana (3,500 sq. km., 52% of the total lakes area) is the largest lake wholly contained in Ethiopia, but a small portion of Lake Turkana and over half of Lake Abbe are also within the territory. A chain of eight small- to medium-sized lakes are situated in the Rift Valley (Lakes Abaya, Abitaya, Awasa, Chamo, Chew Bahir, Langano, Shala, Chamo and Ziway); these cover 40% of the lakes area.\r\nThe very high conductivity of the waters of some of these lakes above them to the highly saline, soda-type lakes typical of the Rift Valley. In addition, there are numerous small, deep crater lakes. These are generally high-altitude lakes, with a mean altitude of 1,750 m; the lowest, apart from Lake Turkana, are the Abaya and Chamo lakes at about 1,250 m.\r\nOther sizeable lakes are those associated with the Awash River (Lakes Beda, Yardi, Afambo and Gemeri) and the isolated Lake Afrera Ye'Ch'ew. Several of the lakes have an interlinking river system.\r\nRivers, floodplains and swamps: there are nine major rivers, totalling 6,400 km with an annual discharge of 63 billion cubic metres, of which the Blue Nile accounts for 80%  (Aubray, 1975) (Ref. 12121). There are six major drainage basins. The major systems are those of the Nile int he northwest and the Indian Ocean systems of Bale and Horor. The Red Sea rivers are mostly short and torrential. There are several closed depressions and numerous lakes associated with the Rift Valley. The largest internal drainage system is the Awash River, running northward along the Rift Valley for over 500 km before dissipating in a complex of salt lakes and marshes (Lakes Abbe and Gemeri).\r\nThe Blue Nile (Abbai) River takes its source from Lake Tana and flows for about 760 km through Ethiopia. It is torrential and steeply encased by mountains for much of its course.\r\nThe Omo River flows south from the central highlands for some 600 km and discharges into Lake Turkana through a small marshy delta. Two other rivers, the Shabale (about 900 km in Ethiopia) and the Ganale (about 500 km in Ethiopia) drain the highlands toward the south and cross the Ogaden Desert before entering Somalia.\r\nReservoirs: there are two large reservoirs (Fincha and Koka) and three smaller impoundments (Zula, Legadadi and Abarda).\r\nCoastal lagoons: there is only one small lagoon near Bera'isole.	11969	The following information is to be sought:\r\n- Status of knowledge of the freshwater fauna;\r\n- Existence of conservation plans;\r\n- Information on major aquatic habitats or sites within the country;\r\n- Current major threats to species;\r\n- Future potential threats to species;\r\n- Contact(s) for further information.	594	null	null	163	0	11	1	57	1	19	23	25	0	21	41	2	4	0	0	-1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	null	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/et.html#	null	null	1	1993-11-17T00:00:00.000Z	14	2012-11-14T00:00:00.000Z	null	null	????????	&#913;&#953;&#952;&#953;&#959;&#960;&#943;&#945;	???????	&#1069;&#1092;&#1080;&#1086;&#1087;&#1080;&#1103;	Éthiopie	Etiopía	Äthiopien 	Ethiopië	Etiópia	Etiopia	Etiopien	null

These islands, along with smaller islands of the Yasawa Group to the west, the Lau Group to the east, and numerous coral reefs, surround the Koro Sea. The island of Rotuma is located to the north. The largest islands are of volcanic origin and are mountainous. The highest peak is Mount Victoria (1,323 m) on Viti Levu. Rich alluvial soil is found in the river deltas. Small islands and islets are composed of coral reef and limestone formations.\r\nClimatic conditions in the islands are tropical, tempered by the southeastern trade winds.

A series of massive mountain ranges, including a number of ranges of the Alps and the Jura, form natural boundaries at the Franco-Italian and most of the Franco-Swiss borders. With flanking chains and foothills, these ranges dominate the area east of the south central plateau. \r\nThe Jura, on the Franco-Swiss boundary, reach an elevation of about 1,723 meters and delineate the eastern frontier of France from the eastern extension of the Rhône Valley to the Belfort Gap, the broad depression linking the basins of the Rhine and the Saône.\r\nFrom the edge of the Belfort Gap to the northeastern corner of France, the Rhine forms the border between France and Germany. The Vosges Mountains, extending north from the Belfort Gap, dominate the region between the River Mosel and the Rhine. The Pyrenees, which extend along the Franco-Spanish frontier from the Mediterranean Sea to the Bay of Biscay, form the other mountain boundary of France. \r\nThe Alps and other ranges in the east are, however, broken by gaps and passes.The south central plateau, known as the Massif Central, is separated from the eastern highland region by the valley of the Rhône. The plateau, rising gradually from the plains region on the north and west, is characterized by volcanic outcrops, by deeply eroded limestone tablelands to the south of the region of extinct volcanoes, and, further to the south, by the Cévennes, a series of highlands rising from the Mediterranean coastal depressions.\r\nThe plains region, by far the most extensive section of the terrain of France, is a projection of the Great Plain of Europe. Except for a few hilly outcrops, chiefly in the west central portion, the French plains consist of gently undulating lowlands, with an elevation of about 200 metres above sea level.\r\nThe northern coast, along the English Channel and the North Sea, is broken by a number of promontories, river estuaries, and minor indentations. From the Brittany peninsula to the Gironde, the Atlantic coastline of France is irregular in outline, and, except in Brittany, is low and sandy. The principal harbours on this part of the coast are those of Brest, Lorient, and Saint-Nazaire.  Southward of the Gironde, the coastline consists of an almost continuous stretch of dunes, bordered by arid moors.\r\n\r\nThe climate of France is generally temperate, but wide regional contrasts occur, as in the Mediterranean coastal area, where subtropical conditions prevail. Temperatures along the Atlantic seaboard are moderated by ocean currents and the prevailing southwestern winds. In the interior, particularly the northeastern region, severe winters and hot summers are usual. The mean annual temperature is about 14°C in Nice, about 10°C in Paris, and about 9°C in Nancy. Precipitation is evenly distributed throughout France, averaging about 760 millimeters annually. The heaviest rainfalls occur in June and October. Regional variations in precipitation range between 1,397 millimeters annually in the mountainous areas and 254 millimeters annually in certain northern lowland areas. One of the meteorological peculiarities of southern France is the mistral, a violent northern wind of the Mediterranean region, originating in the central plateau region.	12263	The outstanding features of the plains region, the most fertile in France, are the valleys of the Seine, the Loire, and the Garonne. Together with numerous tributaries, these rivers drain the Atlantic watershed of France.The Rhône is the largest river in the country in volume of discharge. With its tributaries, particularly the Saône, Isère, and Durance, it drains the French Alpine region.\r\nAmong the principal tributaries of the Seine, which is the main artery of the national inland waterway system, are the Aube, Marne, Oise, and Yonne. Nearly all of the French streams, totaling more than 200, are commercially navigable for varying distances.	12263	France has a highly diversified animal population, and about 40 per cent of Europe’s flora are found here. Forests and woodlands cover about one-quarter of the country, and nearly 10 per cent of the country is protected. Some forests have been damaged by acid rain.\r\nOne and a half century of use of rivers as dams, canals and sewage disposal systems have rendered them badly polluted by sewage, and by industrial and agricultural waste. Some species more sensitive to the changes of their natural habitat have disappeared (@Aphanius iberus@ and @Valencia hispanica@) or have become rare. The continued decrease in some of these populations of freshwater species are due to five causes: 1. obstacles to fish migration, i.e., dams, amassing of large quantities of sediments near estuarine river mouths, water pumps; 2. habitat and nursery destruction, i.e., gravel diggings, water level control in dams, drought, rechanneling of water flow; 3. pollution, i.e., chemical and industrial (detergents, herbicides, pesticides and fertilizers), thermal (from thermoelectric and nuclear plants) and organic (sediments or night soil from draining of ponds and dams); 4. fisheries; 5. alien species introductions and repopulation techniques. There are 25 species of freshwater fish listed as endangered species in Ref. 11941, all of them under some national or international protection directive. Alien species introduction directives are also in place to protect endemic species. Major efforts to improve water quality include building more treatment plants and imposing pollution charges. Fishing regulations are in place, e.g., it is completely prohibited to fish sturgeons; fishing is regulated by location, season, hours of the day, gear and fishing technique, quantity and size of fish caught such that a percentage of the catch should be released back to the water. However, these restrictions have not gone far in protecting fish, e.g., the alewife population from declining.	2163	12263	11941	40	36	27	9	65	21	24	30	17	4	48	2	3	13	1	28	0	-1	437	93	4	45	285	6	22	38	35	3	146	0	0	27	2	11	null	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/fr.html#	null	null	1	1993-11-18T00:00:00.000Z	97	2010-05-20T00:00:00.000Z	null	null	??????	&#915;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#943;&#945;	???????	&#1060;&#1088;&#1072;&#1085;&#1094;&#1080;&#1103;	France	Francia	Frankreich 	Frankrijk	França	Francia	Frankrike	null

Nowhere does the land rise above 40 m in altitude. Much of the river is estuarine and mangroves penetrate upstream for a considerable distance. Salt water penetrates 150 km upstream in the floods and 200 km during the dry season.\r\nThe winters are cool and summers warm. The climate is dry for most of the year, with a single rainy season lasting from June to September. The flood of the river coincides with this.\r\nThe Gambia is a wholly agricultural country whose activities are confined to the banks of the river. There is some rice culture, but little flood control or irrigation. On the whole, the flood regime still controls the activities of the rural communities.	11968	Lakes: there are no lakes.\r\nRivers, floodplains and swamps: the country is dominated by one river, the Gambia, entering from Senegal. During the rainy season about 40% of the country is flooded.\r\nReservoirs: none.\r\nCoastal lagoons: there is one small lagoon on the north shore of the Gambia River estuary near Njakunda.	11968	The following information is to be sought:\r\n- Status of knowledge of the freshwater fauna;\r\n- Existence of conservation plans;\r\n- Information on major aquatic habitats or sites within the country;\r\n- Current major threats to species;\r\n- Future potential threats to species;\r\n- Contact(s) for further information.	594	null	null	66	39	0	2	50	1	13	14	20	0	10	0	0	3	0	1	-1	0	383	105	0	4	282	0	5	1	17	0	99	0	0	23	0	5	null	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/ga.html#	null	null	1	1993-11-17T00:00:00.000Z	97	2010-05-20T00:00:00.000Z	null	null	???????	&#915;&#954;&#940;&#956;&#960;&#953;&#945;	??????	&#1043;&#1072;&#1084;&#1073;&#1080;&#1103;	Gambie	Gambia	Gambia 	Gambia	Gâmbia	Gambia	Gambia 	null

There is a narrow sandy coastal plain, behind which there is a range of low but abrupt hills; to the north there are low-lying plains. The southwestern part of the country is densely forested, and to the north are bush savanna and grasslands.\r\nThe coastal belt is warm, fairly dry to the east, but becoming more humid to the west. The forest zone is very humid but the rest of the country becomes progressively more arid northward. In the south there are two rainy seasons (March-June and September-November), separated by dry periods. In the north the two wet seasons tend to be closer together and merge into one (May-October).\r\nGhana is almost entry agricultural, except for some industries which are located mostly at Tema. The Akosombo Dam was built mostly to provide power for industrialization, especially the Volta Aluminium Company (Valco) based at Tema, which consumes 60% of this power. Ghana also supplies power to Togo and Benin. Forestry is also an important activity in the southwest of the country.	11968	Lakes: the only natural freshwater lake of any size in the country is Lake Bosumtwi, a crater lake situated in Ashanti Region. This supports some commercial fishing activity.\r\nRivers, floodplains and swamps: Ghana is extremely well watered and is drained principally by the Black, White and Red Volta Rivers and the Oti River, but several smaller water couses, including the Pra, Tano and Bia drain the forested southwestern areas. Flooding on the lower Volta River is now controlled by the Akosombo Dam.\r\nThe hydrography of the Volta River is well documented by Nerguaye-Tetteh et al. (1984) (Ref. 12109). The most important flow is from the Oti. Peak flows are between September and October, with an annual average of 1,230 cu. m./s. Examining past trends, it is noted that from 1936 to 1958 conditions altered fairly evenly between wet and dry years. However, from 1962 to 1971 the flow regime was relatively wet; then from 1972 to 1978 it became dry again, followed by two wet years. Thereafter 1981 to 1983 were the driest years of the series, emphasizing the effect of the Sahelian drought. In general, water quality is good for both irrigation and livestock uses.\r\nReservoirs: Ghana contains the largest man-made reservoir in Africa, the 8,482 sq. km. Volta Reservoir. The reservoir, which is backed up behind the Akosombo high dam, is over 400 km long and has drowned much of the lower courses of the various rivers of the Volta system. It is used as a water store to generate electricity, but the severe drought of 1981-83 drastically reduced the output.\r\nDowstream from Volta Reservoir is the newly created Kpong Reservoir. Other smaller reservoirs are Vea and Tono, both in the Upper East Region; Weija and Dawhenya, located near Accra; and Barakese, near Kumasi.\r\nCoastal lagoons: there are about 50 brackishwater lagoons situated along the coast of Ghana with a total surface area of some 400 sq. km. (FAO/IFAD, 1981) (Ref. 12110). These are described in detail by Mensah (1979) (Ref. 12111). The largest of these is the Keta Lagoon, situated around the delta of the Volta River. The nature of this lagoon has changed considerably since the closure of the Akosombo Dam; the former periodic flushes of freshwater do not now occur, and the lagoon has become more saline as a  consequence.\r\nThe salinity and temperature fo the lagoons vary with opening to the sea and flooding of inflowing rivers; open lagoons generally tend to be more productive.	11968	The following information is to be sought:\r\n- Status of knowledge of the freshwater fauna;\r\n- Existence of conservation plans;\r\n- Information on major aquatic habitats or sites within the country;\r\n- Current major threats to species;\r\n- Future potential threats to species;\r\n- Contact(s) for further information.	594	null	null	191	33	3	64	37	6	13	36	45	0	22	4	4	5	0	1	-1	0	408	72	0	34	246	0	8	1	18	0	96	0	1	21	0	6	null	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/gh.html#	null	null	1	1993-11-17T00:00:00.000Z	97	2010-05-20T00:00:00.000Z	null	null	?????	&#915;&#954;&#940;&#957;&#945;	????	&#1043;&#1072;&#1085;&#1072;	Ghana	Ghana	Ghana 	Ghana	Gana	Ghana	Ghana 	null

Vegetation patterns change from tropical forest in the south through semi-tropical savanna to sandy arid hills in the north. Extreme desert conditions prevail in the northwest. The central zone of the country is transected by the Nile Valley with its large swamp depression in the Sudd.\r\nThe north of the country has a desertic climate with little rainfall throughout the year. The centre of the country has an unstable climate, with a pronounced rainy season of variable duration. In the south the climate is equatorial, with more or less daily rainfall.\r\nSudan is mainly a desertic country; there is, therefore, a very high demand for water. The several reservoirs are for flow retention associated with irrigation areas. The Jonglei Canal will allow about 10% of the present Nile flow to bypass the Sudd Swamps to increase the amount of water available for irrigation downstream.	11969	The freshwater resources of the Sudan have been comprehensively reviewed by CSTR (1982) (Ref. 12127). Dumon (1984) (Ref.  12128) presents the most recent series of papers on limnology and marine biology. This text summarizes some of that data. According to OSRO (1986), (Ref. 12129), nearly 12.90 million hectares are under water, 5% of the total area in the Sudan. Of the available water, less than 50% is used, and the potential water supply is enormous if underground reserves are included. The Nile system is the main feature of the hydrology of Sudan, including the Nile and its tributaries, a number of man-made lakes and the swamps of the Sudd. Non-Nilotic streams of minor importance supply water to 806 hafirs (natural depressions enlarged into small ponds) and 31 dams.\r\nLakes: the principal natural lakes in the country are the numerous small floodplain lakes, most important of which is Lake No, which concentrates the major part of the flow from the Nile as it emerges from the Sudd. A few smaller isolated lakes also occur (Welcomme, 1979) (Ref. 12130).\r\nRivers, floodplains and swamps: the main river system is that of the Nile. The Albert Nile enters Sudan from Uganda through a narrow gorge in a series of rapids at Nimule. Northward, it becomes known as the Bahr El Jebel which flows into the great swamps of southern Sudan, North of Mangola. The main tributary of the Bahr El Jebel is the Aswa, originating from the Marolo mountain on the Kenyan border. The river widens to several kilometers and divides into the Bahr El Jebel and Bahr El Zeraf in the Sudd Region. There the rivers have numerous channels and follow a serpentine course, to be joined by the Bahr El Ghazal, which drains the southwest part of Sudan, forming the White Nile. South of Malakal, the Sobat River of a catchment area of 224,000 sq. km. consisting of the Baro and Pibar tributaries, joins the While Nile. From here northward the valley is steep sided until it joins the Blue Nile at Khartoum.\r\nThe Blue Nile, with a catchment of 325,000 sq. km., originates in Ethiopia and extends 2,000 km until it joins the White Nile to become the River Nile. Within Sudan the Blue Nile is joined by the Dinder and Rabad tributaries. The main Nile passes the Sabaloka Gorge and is joined by the Atbara, a catchment of 100,000 sq. km. and main tributary Sesit. Thereafter, there are two further cataracts before the Nile leaves Sudan at Lake Nubia.\r\nReservoirs: a number of major reservoirs have been built or are proposed for the Nile system, mainly for irrigation water storage. Conditions require some form of water storage for the dry period. Natural depressions were enlarged into small ponds of up to 500,000 cu. m., deep; these are known as "hafirs". \r\nCoastal lagoons: there are no lagoons of significant size.	11969	The following information is to be sought:\r\n- Status of knowledge of the freshwater fauna;\r\n- Existence of conservation plans;\r\n- Information on major aquatic habitats or sites within the country;\r\n- Current major threats to species;\r\n- Future potential threats to species;\r\n- Contact(s) for further information.	594	null	null	122	8	4	0	59	1	17	14	26	0	18	4	3	4	0	0	-1	0	301	33	0	3	240	0	23	0	96	0	105	0	0	11	0	2	null	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/su.html#	null	null	1	1993-11-17T00:00:00.000Z	949	2014-07-28T00:00:00.000Z	null	null	??????	&#931;&#959;&#965;&#948;&#940;&#957;	?????	&#1057;&#1091;&#1076;&#1072;&#1085;	Soudan	Sudán	Sudan 	Soedan	Sudão	Sudan	Sudan 	null

It comprises two of the Leeward Islands, Nevis and Saint Kitts, in the Caribbean Islands. The nearest country is the island nation of Antigua and Barbuda to the east. The islands are volcanic with mountainous interiors. The island of Saint Kitts is traversed by a volcanic mountain range, the highest point of which is Mount Misery (1,156 m).\r\n\r\nThe climate is tropical. The average annual temperature is 27°C. Hurricanes are a threat from July to October.	12263	null	null	There has been some loss of forests and woodlands in the past two decades, leading to soil erosion. Some pollution of coastline is occurring as a result of oil spills from nearby tanker lanes. Ecotourism is being encouraged by the government, which is pushing for a national park on Nevis, similar to the one on Saint Kitts. Fishing is taking its toll on the coral reefs of the islands.	12263	null	null	0	7	0	0	8	0	3	0	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	419	39	0	0	285	0	13	0	154	0	98	0	0	15	0	4	null	null	#https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/sc.html#	#http://www.caricom-fisheries.com/stkitts_nevis-fisheries#	null	1	1993-11-19T00:00:00.000Z	303	2014-05-01T00:00:00.000Z	null	null	???? ???? ??? ?????	&#931;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#32;&#922;&#953;&#964;&#962;&#32;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#32;&#925;&#949;&#946;&#953;&#962;	????-???? ? ?????	&#1057;&#1077;&#1085;&#1090;&#45;&#1050;&#1080;&#1090;&#1089;&#32;&#1080;&#32;&#1053;&#1077;&#1074;&#1080;&#1089;	Saint-Kitts-et-Nevis	San Cristóbal y Nieves	Saint Kitts und Nevis 	Saint Kitts en Nevis	São Cristovão e Nevis	Saint Kitts e Nevis	Saint Kitts och Nevis	null
