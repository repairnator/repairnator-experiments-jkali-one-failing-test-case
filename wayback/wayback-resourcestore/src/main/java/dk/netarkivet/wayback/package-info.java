/**
 * Provides tools for integrating NetarchiveSuite with the open-source wayback machine for browsing webarchives. 
 * The tools we provide include:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A plugin to enable wayback to access arcrecords through a NetarchiveSuite arcrepository.
 *   <li>Batch jobs to enable indexing of arcfiles and deduplication records via the batch interface to the NetarchiveSuite 
 *       arcrepository. These are also described in the Additional Tools Manual.
 *  <li> Two command-line applications which enable the continuous automatic indexing of a running NetarchiveSuite 
 *       installation. These applications are deployed along with other !NetarchiveSuite applications and they are therefore 
 *       described in the Configuration Manual.
 *   </ul>
