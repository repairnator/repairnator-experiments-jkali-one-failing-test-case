 * This page describes the steps to follow for developers when documenting the API.

 * <ul>
 *     <li>Do not use code comments for explaining the code; code should be self-explaining. But it can be necessary to explain the rationale for the solutions.</li>
 *     <li>Models should link to their commands and builders.</li>
 *     <li>Every h3 tag should have an id to be referenced and in the toc.</li>
