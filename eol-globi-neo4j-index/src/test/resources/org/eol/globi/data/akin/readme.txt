Hi Joritt,

  The source data should have been the two tabs labeled:  summer2 and winte=
r2.   I had done some cleaning of the original data, removing the summation=
s mostly.

Hi Joritt,

  On a quick look it looks like that is it.  Thanks so much.

No problem.  Happy to help a good cause.



  One thing I noticed was the number of records (lines) of data for Akin in=
creased quite a bit from the last time.  Did you include the stomachs with =
zero food this time??  (as you should) or is there something amiss??  I hav=
e a number of 32619 from last time and this time it is 41523, which is quit=
e an increase.

Yes, empty stomachs should be included.  Please confirm that I used the cor=
rect version of the source data.  The source data that I used can be found =

Also, I took a quick look at your java code and do have a question about it=
.  Perhaps we might want to talk on the phone about some of these things, a=
nd I can take a look at Blewett and see what needs to be done there.


I'd be happy to answer questions you have.  Feel free to call me at 415 217=

  I really hope to get the data entered here in shape soon, but it will sti=

I am looking forward to receiving more excel sheets willed to the gills wit=
h trophic data. ; )



Take care.  Talk with you soon.

Jim

Hello Jim,

Included in latest csv export of the normalized and integrated datasets.

You''ll find that akin data (starting column 8063) now includes columns:

"total predator stomach volume (ml)",
"prey volume in stomach (ml)",
"collection year",
"collection month",
"collection day of month"

Please let me know if there's any other data that you'd like to see normali=
zed for the Akin dataset.

If not, I am hoping to move on to Blewett dataset soon.

thx,
-jorrit
