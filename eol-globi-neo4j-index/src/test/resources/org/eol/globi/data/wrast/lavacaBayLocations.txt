csv file with same name as this one was extracted from sheet "edited for Jorrit" from "Port Lavaca Waypoints Excel File.xls

The email exchange below contains information on how to link the location information to the lavaca bay trophic data.

Yes, that is correct.

Thanks for the update.  If I understand it correctly, the combination of region, habitat and site identifies ties a collection point to a location.  If there are two matches for combination of region, habitat and site, then the mid-point should be used.

For instance,

from line 2, trophic data excel sheet:
Lower  Fall      Marsh  1          Sciaenidae       Sciaenops ocellatus     420

matches with two locations:
LM1

28.595267

-96.477033

Lower

Marsh edge

1

LSG1

28.596233

-96.476483

Lower

Marsh edge

1


because the combination region-habitat-site, in this case, Lower-Marsh-1, has two matches.

In this case the mid-point is taken, with would be:

lat = avg({28.596233, 28.595267})
and
long = avg({-96.477033, -96.476483})

Please let me know if this is correct.

thx,

Hi Jorrit,

 I am attaching a file with the Lavaca Bay points.  It is in a tab labeled “Edited for Jorrit”.  You will see that for most of the sites there are two sets of coordinates.  Jenny pooled the data from those two , ie the two 1’s are pooled in the data set.  You could find the mid-point for those points.  Only for the Upper Non-veg and Marsh edge is this not an issue.  But this should enable you to get some coordinates to the data.

 Let me know if you have any questions,

Jim
