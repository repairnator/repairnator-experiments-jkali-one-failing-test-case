<div>
    GitHub events or statuses that should or should not trigger a build of a pull request.
    <br/>
    The specified events will be checked in order, and the first to match will
    be used, so be sure to put events/statuses that should prevent triggering a
    build first in order.
    <br/>
    For performance reasons, "Pull Request Opened" should go before other
    events that require more detailed checking of the pull request, such as
    "Comment Matched to Pattern". But if you want to skip PR, you must place skip events firstly.
