/**
 * A simple <i>one-shot</i> iterable wrapper for a reader.
 * <p>
 * It has been designed for a single use in a for statement.
 * A second use will of the same Object will cause an Exception.
 * <p>
 * Any Exception thrown by the Reader during iteration are intercepted and
 *      not throw.
 * <p>
 * The Iterator will automatically close the underlying reader when hasNext()
 *      returns false, which includes when it leaves a for loop.
 * Any Exception thrown by the Reader during this close are intercepted and
 *      not throw.
 * <p>
 * It is recommended to always specifically call the Iterable's close method
 *      after finishing with the Iteration.
 * It makes sure the underlying reader has been closed.
 * It also raises the first Exception that may have been trapped during an
 *      early next() or hasNext() including during the reader closed done then.
 * The recommended way to make sure close is called is with a
 *      try-with-resources statement
