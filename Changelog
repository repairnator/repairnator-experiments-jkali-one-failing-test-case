- Added binary data encoding with leading size specified (similar to string)
- Changed the spreadsheet to make it clerarer the difference between raw value, encoding (how to decode the raw value from the binary) and engineering value (raw value passed through a calibration function)
- For standalone parameters (i.e. not extracted from XTCE packets) coming without an enginnering value, 
  calibrate (raw->eng value) them inside the processor rather than before being injected in the stream.
  This means the parameters are stored in the L0 archive also in the initial form (could be raw+eng,only raw or only eng) and they are calibrated (using the current MDB) for each replay
  Of course ParameterArchive will store them calibrated.
- Added a command to check the configuration by loading the services without starting them

      - read alarms
      - read string parameters
      - read multiple space systems

    2. All instance services are created
    3. All global services are started
    4. All instance services are started
    
    Used to be 1,3,(2,4)+ - and this makes for example the HttpServer to be started before the instances are created and some methods (like subscribe event,time,etc) will fail at first because the processor is not available.
