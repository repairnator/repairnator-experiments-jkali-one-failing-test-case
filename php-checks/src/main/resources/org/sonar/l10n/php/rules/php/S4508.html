<p>Deserializing objects is security-sensitive. For example, it has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0694">CVE-2012-0694</a>: SugarCRM: Unserialize PHP Code Execution </li>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1000058">CVE-2018-1000058</a>: Jenkins Pipeline: arbitrary code execution
  vulnerability </li>
</ul>
<p>Object deserialization from an untrusted source can lead to unexpected code execution. Deserialization takes a stream of bits and turns it into an
object. If the stream contains the type of object you expect, all is well. But if you're deserializing untrusted input, and an attacker has inserted
some other type of object, you're in trouble. Why? There are a few different attack scenarios, but one widely-documented one goes like this:
Deserialization first instantiates the <code>Object</code>, then PHP will automatically attempt to call the <code>__wakeup()</code> member to
reconstruct any resources that the object may have. If the attacker has overridden <code>__wakeup()</code> then he is entirely in control of what code
executes during that process.</p>
