<p>OS commands are security-sensitive. For example, their use has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12465">CVE-2018-12465</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7187">CVE-2018-7187</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>Applications that execute operating system commands or execute commands that interact with the underlying system should neutralize any
externally-provided input used to construct those commands. Failure to do so could allow an attacker to execute unexpected or dangerous commands,
potentially leading to loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability.</p>
