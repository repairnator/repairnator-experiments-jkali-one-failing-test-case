            <p class="em">After a specified period of time the current version of searchcode server can be re-licensed under the GPL v3. This is a shifting date such that each new release extends its own eventually open date further into the future. However the older releases time is still fixed. The eventually open clause for version 1.2.3 and 1.2.4 takes place on the 27th August 2019 at which point you can take the source using GPL 3.0. Assuming searchcode server 6.1.2 comes out at roughly the same time its eventually open date will be set to the 27th of August 2022 but the 1.2.3 release will be unaffected.</p>
