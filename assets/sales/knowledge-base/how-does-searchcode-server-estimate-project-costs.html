            <p class="em">The estimated cost for any file or project is created using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COCOMO">Basic COCOMO</a> algorithmic software cost estimation model. The cost reflected includes design, coding, testing, documentation for both developers and users, equipment, buildings. This can result in a higher estimate then would be expected. Generally consider this the cost of developing the code, and not what it is "worth". It is based on an average salary of $56,000 per year but this value can be changed by the system administrator if the values appear to be too out of expectation.</p>
            <p class="em">The calculation itself is very simple. <code>estimatedCost = estimatedEffort * (averageWage / 12) * 1.8</code> where estimated effort is calculated by the following <code>estimatedEffort = 3.2 * Math.pow(linesOfCode / 1000, 1.05)</code>. By default the average wage is set to $56,000 (this can be overridden on the setting's page) and the linesOfCode is the number of lines of code in the file ignoring comments and blank lines.</p>
