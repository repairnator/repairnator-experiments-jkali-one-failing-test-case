<h1>Automatic Processing</h1>

<p>Since version 1.4, the annotation can be supported by automatic 
tools. They are  accessible via the <i>Tools</i> menu and the list

Important: Some components only work for specific languages. Before 
running them, you will need to set the document language correctly. 
Please also note that many components do not work flawlessly. They 
are included to speed up the annotation process, but <strong>do not replace 
manual inspection</strong>.</p>

entity.</p>
