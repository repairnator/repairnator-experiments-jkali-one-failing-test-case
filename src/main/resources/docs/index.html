<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>CorefAnnotator is an annotation tool for coreference, i.e., to mark 
whenever two or more words in a text refer to the same thing in the real world.
We will refer to the words in a text as <i>mentions</i> and to the things in
 the real world as <i>entities</i>. Entities don't have to be touchable or 
 concrete. </p>
<p>CorefAnnotator displays two views: The text on the left, and a tree on 
the right. Mentions in the text can be selected with a point device (e.g., 
mouse). To create a new entity in the tree on the right, either drag the 
selected mention onto the root node of the tree, or click "new" in the tool bar. 
Newly created entities then get a color assigned, and all their mentions in the 
text are underlined with the color. Selecting a mention in the tree also selects 
the mention in the text (and scrolls to an appropriate position if necessary). 
Clicking on a mention in the text view shows a context menu with all mentions 
that cover
a certain text span. From there, one can reveal the mention in the tree or 
directly delete id.</p>

<p>In addition to a color, each entity has an assigned key code. This single 
letter shortcut can be used to quickly assign mentions to entities (without 
dragging). Both colors and key codes can be changed at any time, as can the 
name of the entity that is displayed in the tree.</p>
 
<h2>Annotation Concepts</h2>
<h3>Difficult cases <img src="warning.png" width="20" height="20"/></h3>
<p>While annotating, one typically stumbles upon difficult cases that 
need to be discussed with peers or supervisors. To support these discussions, 
difficult <i>mentions</i> can be tagged with the exclamation mark symbol: 
<img src="warning.png" width="15" height="15"/>.</p>

<h3>Groups <img src="group.png" height="20" width="20"/></h3>
<p>Sometimes, anaphoric expressions can appear in plural without a plural 
antecedent. In these cases, entities can be grouped into entity groups.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Mary was eating ice cream with John. <u>They</u> had a lot of fun.<br/>
"They" in the previous example refers to both Mary and John, but they are 
not present as an antecedent.</p>
<p>In CorefAnnotator, any number of entities can be selected and formed as a 
group entity. Group entities behave like regular entities (i.e., one can drag 
and drop mentions onto them, assign shortcuts and colors), but they appear 
separately at the bottom of the tree view. If they are expanded, entity groups 
reveal their members (which are entities), as well as the mentions that are 
used to refer to the group.</p>

<h3>Genericity <img src="cloud.png" width="20" height="20"/></h3>
<p>Genericity expresses whether an entity is a kind, instead of an instance. 
The prototypical example is shown in (1) and (2):<br/>
(1) <u>The elephant</u> met a rabbit. He asked him to be his friends. <br/>
(2) When under water, <u>the elephant</u> uses its trunk as a snorkel.<br/>
The underlined strings are exactly the same, but the first refers to a specific 
instance or individual of a class, while the second refers to the class as a 
whole.</p>

<p>In CorefAnnotator, entities can be marked as generic via the context or top 
menu. Generic entities are marked with the cloud symbol:

<h2>Import / Export</h2>
<p>CorefAnnotator uses UIMA's XMI file format to store annotations and meta 
data, with a custom type system. Only XMI files using this type system (i.e., 
produced through <i>Save as...</i>) can be directly opened and saved. XMI files
using other type systems can be imported and (sometimes) also exported. 
Non-XMI files are not supported at the moment &emdash; with the only exception that
it is possible to import plain text files.</p>
