<h1>Compare annotations</h1>
<p>The compare view allows the joined view of two (or more) annotated 
documents. As of version 1.3, it only allows comparison of the spans of 
the annotation mentions.</p>

<p>The compare view shows the document in text view, and the annotated 
mentions underlined. Colors, however, do <strong>not</strong> signal 
different entities, as in the regular annotation view. Instead, each 
annotator is represented by a color, and all annotations that are not 
in agreement are underlined by the annotators color. Annotated spans 
that are marked by all annotators are underlined in gray.</p>

<h2>Statistics</h2>
<p>The panel on the right shows some numbers about the agreement. Note 
that this is only a rough estimate, and only shows observed agreement.</p>
