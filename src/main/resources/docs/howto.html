<h1>How to annotate</h1>

<h2>By drag and drop</h2>

<p>To create a new entity, first select any segment of text in the text view 
(on the left). With a mouse (or other point device), drag the selection onto 
the top most node in the tree on the right. If you drop the selection, a new 
entity will be created, with a single mention. The entity now appears in the 
tree with a specific color, and the text segment you marked in the text is now
underlined with the same color. The name of the entity will be the same as 
the text segment. Both name and color can be changed at any time.</p>

<h2>By keyboard</h2>

<p>CorefAnnotator can be used by keyboard. To annotate, mark a text segment 
using <code>SHIFT</code> and the <code>RIGHT ARROW</code> key. When you're done 
with text highlighting, press <code>TAB</code> once to jump to the search field 
on top of the tree view. In the search field, you may enter words, substrings 
or even regular expressions, to search among all entity labels and mention 
surfaces. All matching entities will be sorted to the top of the tree. Using 
<code>ARROW DOWN</code> you can then select an entity in the tree. To annotate, 
press <code>ENTER</code> while the correct entity is selected.

<h2>By shortcut</h2>

<p>Each entity can be assigned a single letter shortcut. This is done via the 
edit menu or by right-clicking on an entity. When text is selected, a single 
key can be pressed to assign the mention to an existing entity.</p>

<h2>Context-derived candidates</h2>

<p>If a text string is selected, clicking the right mouse button (or 
pressing the space bar on the keyboard) shows a context menu that
contains candidates. The candidates are based on the previous mentions
as well as textual overlap with the mentions of any other entities.</p>
