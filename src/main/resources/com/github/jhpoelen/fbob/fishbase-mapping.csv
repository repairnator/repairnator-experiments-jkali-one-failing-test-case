This is a parameter that can be obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase as described in jhpoelen/fb-osmose-bridge/issues/140 
fecundity,RelFecundityMean and SpawningCycles,species.relativefecundity.sp,NA,Annual number of eggs per gram of mature female. This is a parameter that can easily be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase; for a given focal functional group the RelFecundity and SpawningCycles parameters can be extracted from  FishBase/SeaLifeBase and multiplied together to get an estimate of annual number of eggs per gram of mature female. Definitions of RelFecundity and SpawningCycles can be found at: ropensci/fishbaseapi/blob/master/docs/docs-sources/fecundity.csv
fecundity,SpawningCycles,fecundity.SpawningCycles,NA,Number of spawning cycles per year
fecundity,RelFecundityMean,fecundity.RelFecundityMean,NA,no. of mature oocytes per gram total weight
spawning,SexRatiomid,spawning.SexRatiomid,50,percentage of spawning females in spawning stock; female:male sex ratio (species.sexratio.sp) in OSMOSE is a quantity lower than 1 and is derived from this variable
popqb,PopQB,predation.ingestion.rate.max.sp,3.5,Maximum annual ingestion rate expressed in grams of food per gram of individual and per year. This parameter is usually set to 3.5 g of food per g of individual and per year for all focal functional groups in OSMOSE models. It is similar to Ecopath's Q/B parameter. This parameter can be directly obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase
popqb,MaintQB,popqb.MaintQB,NA,needed for calculation of predator.efficiency.critical.sp
popqb,MaintQB and PopQB,predation.efficiency.critical.sp,0.57,Critical predation efficiency. This is the predation efficiency ensuring body maintenance. This parameter is usually set to 0.57 for all focal functional groups in OSMOSE models. This is a parameter can easily be obtained by extracting the MaintQB and PopQB parameters in FishBase's popqb.csv and dividing the former parameter by the latter.
estimate,PredPreyRatioMin,predation.predPrey.sizeRatio.max.sp,3.5,Minimum predator/prey size ratios defined for juveniles (immature individuals) and adults (mature individuals) of each focal functional group.

These are parameters that could possibly be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase to my mind. Deng Palomares once mentioned that Predator/prey size ratios could be estimated by FishBase/SeaLifeBase from a calculation of gape size; gape size can be obtained as a percentage of total length (see morphometrics in FishBase/SeaLifeBase).
