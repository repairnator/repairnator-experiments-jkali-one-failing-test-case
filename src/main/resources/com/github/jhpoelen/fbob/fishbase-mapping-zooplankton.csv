FishBase table,FishBase column(s),OSMOSE property,Default value,Notes from Arnaud
estimate,Troph,plankton.TL.plk,2,Trophic level of a background functional group. This parameter can be obtained directly from FishBase/SeaLifeBase
popll,LengthMin,plankton.size.min.plk,0.002,Minimum size of a background functional group. This is a parameter that can be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase. (1) The minimum size of all the reference species of the background functional group could be obtained through the bridge between FishBase/SeaLifeBase and OSMOSE simply by extracting LenghMin parameters from the popll table. (2) A minimum size could be defined for the background functional group as the minimum over all the minimum sizes of reference species.
popll,LengthMax,plankton.size.max.plk,0.3,Maximum size of a background functional group. This is a parameter that can be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase. (1) The maximum size of all the reference species of the background functional group could be obtained through the bridge between FishBase/SeaLifeBase and OSMOSE simply by extracting LenghMax parameters from the popll table. (2) A maximum size could be defined for the background functional group as the maximum over all the maximum sizes of reference species.
