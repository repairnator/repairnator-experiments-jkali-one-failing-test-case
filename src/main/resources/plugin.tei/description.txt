This plugin imports from arbitrary XML/TEI files. The entire textual 
content including the header is treated as the document text, i.e., 
everything not in tags will be in the document. All 
elements with the attribute 'ref' are treated as a mention. Exporting 
into TEI/XML only works when the document has been imported from 
TEI/XML before.
