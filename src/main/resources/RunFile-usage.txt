BPjs Execution Runtime

This program takes a series of BPjs files, and executes them 
as a single BProgram.

Use "-" to also read from stdin.

BProgram log and event sequence are written to stdout.

Switches:
   -v ("verbose")
        Print more data about the BProgram's status as synchronization points..
