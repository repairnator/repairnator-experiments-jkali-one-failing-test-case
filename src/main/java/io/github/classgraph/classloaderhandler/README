This directory contains ClassLoaderHandlers: classes that know how to extract classpath
entries from different ClassLoaders.

You can register your own custom ClassLoaderHandler with ClassGraph by calling
ClassGraph#registerClassLoaderHandler() before calling #scan().

Note that URLClassLoader subclasses do not need a custom ClassLoaderHandler, they are
handled automatically by ClassGraph.

If a new default ClassLoaderHandler is added to ClassGraph, then it should be added to
the list in ClassLoaderHandlerRegistry.
