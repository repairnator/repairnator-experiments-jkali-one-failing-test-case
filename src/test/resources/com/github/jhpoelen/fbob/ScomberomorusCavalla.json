      "Comments": "Often found in outer reef areas.  Larvae are encountered in surface waters of 26.3° to 31°C and 26.9 to 35 ppt.  Feeds primarily on fishes with smaller quantities of penaeid shrimps and squids.  Large schools have been found to migrate over considerable distances along the Atlantic US coast, water temperature permitting.  It is an important species for recreational, commercial, and artisanal fisheries throughout its range.  Most of the catch is processed into steaks or sold fresh, or sometimes canned and salted.  Also prepared smoked and frozen (Ref. 9987).  Potentially ciguatoxic in certain areas (Ref. 9710).  Sometimes called \"Kingfish\" (Ref. 13442).",
