<p>Some tools such as Git work better when files end with an empty line. This rule simply generates an issue if it is missing.</p>
<p>For example, a Git diff looks like this if the empty line is missing at the end of the file:</p>
<p>&lt;pre&gt;</p>
<p>+class Test:</p>
<p>+ pass</p>
<p> \ No newline at end of file</p>
<p>&lt;/pre&gt;</p>
