<p>The new style of class creation, with the declaration of a parent class, created a unified object model in Python, so that the type of an
instantiated class is equal to its class. In Python 2.2-2.7, this is not the case for old-style classes. In Python 3+ all classes are new-style
classes. However, since the behavior can differ from 2.2+ to 3+, explicitly inheriting from <code>object</code> (if there is no better candidate) is
recommended.</p>

<pre>
class MyClass():
    pass

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
class MyClass(object):
