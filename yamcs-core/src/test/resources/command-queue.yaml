# Definitions of command queues
# Eeach queue has a name, a default state and a list of roles
# There are three possible states:
#   - enabled means the commands are sent immediately
#   - blocked means the commands are accepted into the queue but need to be
#     manually sent
#   - disabled means the commands are rejected
# There is always a commandqueue called "default". It can be  redefined here
# in order to have a different state
# If a command comes from a user which is not defined by any other queue,
#   it is put into the default queue
