                <h1 class="FirstChild">Security Aspects</h1>

                
	<p>XStream is designed to be an easy to use library.  It takes its main task seriously: converting Java objects to
	XML, and XML to Java objects. As a result, it is possible to create an instance of XStream with the default
	constructor, call a method to convert an object into XML, then call another method to turn the XML back into an
	equivalent Java object.  By design, there are few limits to the type of objects XStream can handle.</p>
 
    <p class=highlight>Note: XStream supports other data formats than XML, e.g. JSON. Those formats can be used for
    the same attacks.</p>
 	
	<p>This flexibility comes at a price.  XStream applies various techniques under the hood to ensure it is able to
 	handle all types of objects.  This includes using undocumented Java features and reflection.  The XML generated by
 	XStream includes all information required to build objects of almost any type.  This introduces a potential
 	security problem.</p>
 
	<p>The provided XML data is used by XStream to unmarshal Java objects.  This data can be manipulated by injecting
	the XML representation of other objects, that were not present at marshalling time.  An attacker could take
	advantage of this to execute arbitrary code or shell commands in the context of the server running the XStream
	process.  A concrete case is described in <a href="CVE-2013-7285.html">CVE-2013-7285</a>.</p>
 
	<p>Note that the XML data can be manipulated on different levels.  For example, manipulating values on existing
 	objects (such as a price value), or breaking the format and causing the XML parser to fail.  The latter case will
 	raise an exception, but the former case must be handled by validity checks in any application which processes
    user-supplied XML.  A worst case scenario is the injection of arbitrary code or shell commands, as noted above.
    Even worse, <a href="CVE-2017-7957.html">CVE-2017-7957</a> describes a case to crash the Java Virtual Machine
    causing a Denial of Service.</p>
     
    <h2 id="external">External Security</h2>

	<p>An active Java Security Manager can prevent actions required by XStream components or converters.  The same
	applies to environments such as Google Application Engine.  XStream tries to some extent to check the functionality
	of a converter before it claims to handle a type.</p>
         
	<p>Therefore it is possible that XStream behaves differently in such an environment, because a converter suddenly
 	no longer handles a special type or any type at all.  It is essential that an application that will have to run in
 	such an environment is tested at an early stage to prevent nasty surprises.</p>
      
    <h2 id="implicit">Implicit Security</h2>
	
	<p>As explained above, it is possible to inject other object instances if an attacker is able to define the data
	used to deserialize the Java objects.  E.g. a known exploit can be created with the help of the Java runtime
	library using the Java Bean <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/beans/EventHandler.html">EventHandler</a>
	as described in <a href="CVE-2013-7285.html">CVE-2013-7285</a>.  This scenario can be used perfectly to
	replace/inject a dynamic proxy with such an EventHandler at any location	in the XML where its parent expects an
	object of such an interface's type or a simple object instance (any list	element will suffice).  The usage of a
	ProcessBuilder as an embedded element, coupled with the redirection of any call to the ProcessBuilder's
	<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/ProcessBuilder.html#start()">start()</a> method allows
	an attacker to call shell commands.  Knowing how to define such an attack is the only prerequisite.</p>
         
 	<p>More scenarios have been identified for types that are already delivered with the Java runtime.  Looking at 
 	well-known and commonly used Java libraries libraries such as ASM, CGLIB, or Groovy, the possibility for more
 	exploits is very high.</p>
         
	<p class=highlight>Note: These vulnerabilities are not even a special problem of XStream.  XML being deserialized
	by XStream acts here like a script, and the scenario above can be created with any script that is executed within a
 	Java runtime (e.g. using its JavaScript interpreter) if someone is able to manipulate it externally.  The key
 	message for application developers is that deserializing arbitrary user-supplied content is a dangerous proposition
 	in all cases. The best approach to prevent such an attach is a <a href="#example">white list</a>, i.e. the
 	deserialization mechanism should only allow explicit types.</p>
    
    <h2 id="explicit">Explicit Security</h2>
    
	<p>Starting with XStream 1.4.7, it is possible to define <a href="#framework">permissions</a> for types, to check
	the type of an object that should be unmarshalled.  Those permissions can be used to allow or deny types explicitly
	With these permissions it is at least not possible to inject unexpected types into an object graph.  The security
	framework supports the setup of a black or white listing scenario.  Any application should use this feature to
	limit the danger of arbitrary command execution if it deserializes data from an external source.</p>
	
	<p>XStream itself sets up a white list by default, i.e. it blocks all classes except those types it has explicit
	converters for.  Nonetheless, it is still the better approach to maintain an own white list for an XStream
	instance.  A black list scenario should be avoided in general, because it provides a false sense of security.</p>
         
	<p class=highlight>Apart from value manipulations, this implementation still allows the injection of allowed
	objects at wrong locations, e.g. inserting an integer into a list of strings.</p>
         
	<p>Separate to the XStream security framework, it has always been possible to overwrite the setupConverter method
	of XStream to register only the required converters.</p>
    
    <h2 id="validation">XML Validation</h2>

	<p>XML itself supports input validation using a schema and a validating parser.  With XStream, you can use e.g. a
	DOM parser for validation, but it will take some effort to ensure that the XML read and written by XStream matches
	the schema in first place, because XStream uses additionally own attributes.  Typically you will have to write some
	custom converters, but it can be worth the effort depending on the use case.</p>

    <h1 id="framework">Security Framework</h1>

	<p>Noted above, it might be possible that other combinations are found with the Java runtime itself, or other
	commonly-used Java libraries that allow a similar vulnerability like the known case using the Java Beans
	EventHandler.  To prevent such a possibility at all, XStream version 1.4.7 and above contains a security framework,
	allowing application developers to define which types are allowed to be unmarshalled with XStream.</p>
         
	<p>The core interface is <a href="javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/security/TypePermission.html">TypePermission</a>.
	The <a href="javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/mapper/SecurityMapper.html">SecurityMapper</a> will evaluate a list
	of registered instances for every type that will be required while unmarshalling input data.  The interface has one
	simple method:</p><div class="Source Java"><pre>boolean allow(Class&lt;?&gt;);</pre></div>
         
	<p>The <a href="javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/XStream.html">XStream</a> facade provides the following methods to
	register such type permissions within the SecurityMapper:</p><div class="Source Java">
<pre>XStream.addPermission(TypePermission);
XStream.allowTypes(Class&lt;?&gt;...);
XStream.allowTypes(String...);
XStream.allowTypesByRegExp(String...);
XStream.allowTypesByRegExp(Pattern...);
XStream.allowTypesByWildcard(String...);
XStream.allowTypeHierary(Class&lt;?&gt;);
XStream.denyPermission(TypePermission);
XStream.denyTypes(Class&lt;?&gt;...);
XStream.denyTypes(String...);
XStream.denyTypesByRegExp(String...);
XStream.denyTypesByRegExp(Pattern...);
XStream.denyTypesByWildcard(String...);
XStream.denyTypeHierary(Class&lt;?&gt;);</pre></div>

	<p>The sequence of registration is essential. The most recently registered permission will be evaluated first.</p>
         
	<p>Every TypePermission has three options to implement the allow method and make decisions on the provided type:<p>
	<ul>
	<li>if the method returns <i>true</i>, the type is accepted and no other permissions are evaluated</li>
	<li>if the method returns <i>false</i>, the implementation cannot judge over the type and the SecurityMapper will
	continue with the next permission instance in its registration list</li>
	<li>the method throws a <a href="javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/security/ForbiddenClassException.html">ForbiddenClassException</a>
	to stop the unmarshalling process</li>
	</ul>
         
    <h2 id="predefined">Predefined Permission Types</h2>

	<p>XStream provides some TypePermission implementations to allow any or no type at all, to allow primitive types
	and their counterpart, null, array types, implementations match the name of the type by regular or wildcard
	expression and one to invert a permission.</p>

	<p>XStream uses the default permissions from the table above.  You may either clear out this default
	and register your own permissions to activate the security framework simply add your own permissions on top of it
	(the Blog type is from the 	<a href="alias-tutorial.html">Alias Tutorial</a>):</p>
<div class="Source Java"><pre>XStream xstream = new XStream();
// clear out existing permissions and set own ones
xstream.addPermission(NoTypePermission.NONE);
// allow some basics
xstream.addPermission(NullPermission.NULL);
xstream.addPermission(PrimitiveTypePermission.PRIMITIVES);
xstream.allowTypeHierarchy(Collection.class);
// allow any type from the same package
xstream.allowTypesByWildcard(Blog.class.getPackage().getName()+".*");
</pre></div>

  <p>You may have a further look at XStream's acceptance tests, the security framework is enabled there in general.</p>
