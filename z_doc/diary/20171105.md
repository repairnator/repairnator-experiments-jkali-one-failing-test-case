I discovered I get into a cycle when a type has a constant of the same type:    
e.g.   
class Person {  
private final Sex sex;   
}   

class Sex {   
    public static final Sex MALE = new Sex();   
    ...   
}

The default comparator provider will give an object comparator for the type Person.
Then it will find its field sex of the type Sex. The object comparator will be returned for the type Sex.
This type Sex has a field of type sex (i.e. MALE) which will be selected to be compared. 
The object comparator will be used again.
It will select the field MALE again and next time again and again. Stackoverflow. Ouch!

Moreover comparing the same constant with itself makes no sense.
