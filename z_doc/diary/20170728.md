28.07.2017 Array comparator concerns me

Demos for array comparator do not work as I expect.
Although I wrote so many tests I feel the array comparator is not very useful.
Therefore I created some practical tests. I need more of them and more demos.
Moreover I must rethink the design of the result of array comparator.
The tree design with empty arrays and null values is challenging.

Approach A:
A shallow design like the way it is.

Change: add all additional elements (even in sub arrays) to the additional elements map 

Approach B:
A tree design

Additional sub array map with int as array position

Questions:
How reference the results? With relative array positions or absolute positions?

I tend to absolute array positions. Relative array positions are confusing.

I think it is worth redesigning the array comparator to approach B to tackle the potential tree nature of arrays.

Other topic: I think I should go on with array comparator and then consider the general object comparator and THEN turn to basic collection diff algorithms.
I am too deep into thoughts about a useful array comparator. I should not switch to object comparison design in general nor to something else.
I must finish the array comparator.
