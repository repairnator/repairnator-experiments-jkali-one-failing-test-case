15.08.2017 Framework redesigned

Back from a trip to Geneva, Switzerland.
Some ideas came to my mind.

a) Cycles are possible in arrays!  
E.g. Object[] objectArray = new Object[1];   
objectArray[0] = objectArray;   
This is possible because arrays are also objects.
Therefore object arrays need a protection against cycles.

b) Cycle protection must be redesigned.
The current approach of checking the type of the item comparator
and selecting a special compare-method does not work well with pre-comparators. 
A deep getter to access the last comparator is an ugly solution 
because many handy comparators have more than one delegate.
Better use wrapping as it is done with primitives.
