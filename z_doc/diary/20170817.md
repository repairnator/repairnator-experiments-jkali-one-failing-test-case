17.08.2017 Framework redesigned again

The array comparator can applied to more items rather than arrays.  
E.g. List<List<?>>, JTree and JTable are also multidimensional structures similar to arrays.   
Only the access operations are different.   
Lambdas could replace the direct access and make the comparator more functional. 

However, the array comparator cannot compare object graphs very well because 
every node or leaf itself decides how it is compared. 
The selected comparator itself iterates over the compared fields. 
Traversing the fields uses loops and recursion.
 
Therefore I propose introducing two basic traversing comparators:  
* IterativeDepthFirstComparator   
* RecursiveDepthFirstComparator

They combine the advantages of recursion and iteration.
Both comparators must avoid running into infinite loops/recursion because of cycles.
