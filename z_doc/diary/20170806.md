06.08.2017 Array comparator redesigned

The current design works great for one dimensional arrays:
 * similarElements : Map<Position,Element>
 * additionalLeftElements : Map<Position,Element>
 * differentElements : Map<Position,Pair<Element>>
 * additionalRightElements : Map<Position,Element>
 * comparisonResults : Map<Position,ComparisonResult<?,?>>

Why does it not work any more for multidimensional arrays?
 
 * special values: empty arrays and null values  
 Empty arrays and null values are leafs which can occur at every depth of the tree
 * special values enable a tree design   
 It becomes unclear what a result really means and thus it becomes useless. 
 E.g. comparing {{null}} with {{{1,2}}} makes little sense but is possible.
 
How can apply the design to multidimensional arrays though?

 * compare on the same dimension. Do not mix different dimensions.   
 * consider elements in one array additional only if the other array is empty (and not null)
  
E.g. when comparing {} and {{a,b}} consider {a,b} an additional element and not a and b themselves.   
Otherwise you would mix elements of dimension 0 (left) with elements of dimension 1 (right).
