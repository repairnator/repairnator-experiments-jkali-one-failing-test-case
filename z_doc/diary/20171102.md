02.11.2017 Some thoughts

1) Using a generic for the meta type object in the comparator provider interface was a bad idea.
Why? The meta type is a field for all SUB objects but can only be the class type at the beginning 
(we start with an object and not with a field!):   
a) comparatorProvider.provide(classType, leftObject, rightObject)   
b) comparatorProvider.provide(field, leftFieldValue, rightFieldValue)

2) The precomparator construction with mutating the last comparator is a mess!
I must get rid of that.
