01.04.2018 How to deal with boxing?

There are 3 ways for dealing with boxing:
1) ignore boxing
2) CRUD boxed, store non-boxed
3) CRUD non-boxed, store non-boxed

To 1) This enables using the standard Java collection framework implementations

To 2) This enables using the standard Java collection framework interfaces 
but demands non-boxing data structures like apache commons primitives.

To 3) This also forces using custom collection interfaces that avoid boxing.
