19.08.2017 Framework redesigned again

Wrapping the compared items with their visited-objects-trace appears a bad idea to me.
The cleanest solution is extending the item-comparator-interface with a method with an extra parameter.
That makes the interface uglier but it avoids all dirty hacks necessary to "smuggle" the visited-objects-trace into the comparators.
However I need to touch all my item comparators (even the simple ones) again which bothers me.
I can use a default method for the method with the extra parameter that delegates to the one without the extra parameter with a null argument 
but I must modify the pre-comparators. They must pass the visited-objects-trace argument.
Then I can enable cycle detection in the array comparator.   
The array comparator does not run into a stack-overflow-exception yet because it uses the default equal comparator.
This scencario is unlikely because the array comparator should ask the centrall item comparator provider in future for a useful comparator.
If the item provider provides another array comparator and the array includes a cycle the stack-overflow-exception will occur.
I must avoid that.

02:25:
An idea came to my mind:   
Adding the extra parameter enables cycle checking in a separate, decorating item comparator.
That leaves out the logic for it from all item comparators that may run into an infinite recursion/loop with cycles.
