08.08.2017 Array comparator improved

The array comparator becomes more useful if you can    
a) set the start position    
b) set the order (i.e. also support reverse order)

Remarks to a)   
Setting the right start position can same unnecessary iterations.
However it must exist which must be checked at the beginning of the comparison.

Remarks to b)   
Reverse order is often an underestimated feature.
The iteration flow must not be changed a lot.
The if-clauses must also check against index underflow and the increment index operation turns into a decrement.
