BPjs is a library for executing behavioral programs written in Javascript. It can
be used from the commandline, or embedded in a Java application.

BPjs is an open source project, maintained by a research group in Ben-Gurion
University of the Negev, Israel. The code is `available on GitHub`_.

.. _available on GitHub: https://github.com/bThink-BGU/BPjs

Here you can learn about :doc:`writing <BPjsTutorial/index>` and :doc:`executing <execute-bpjs>` BPjs programs,
:doc:`embedding <embed-bpjs>` BPjs programs in larger Java systems (or any JVM-based systems, really),
and extending and modifying BPjs' behavior.

.. tip:: If you are new to Behavioral Programming (that's alright, it's a fairly new concept), you're invited to read the `quick intro 	

.. note:: Model checking for behavioral programs is coming soon!

.. todo: add structure of a bprogram diagram, event queue, listeners etc.
