== Installation

* Default (main) Update Center from jenkins installation.
* Experimental releases are in https://jenkins-ci.org/content/experimental-plugins-update-center/[Experimental Update Center].
Which is also the preferred way of installation.
* If you don't want to change your Update Center, you can the download the `.hpi` from a mirror
http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/plugins/github-pullrequest/ and upload it to Jenkins Plugin Manager.
