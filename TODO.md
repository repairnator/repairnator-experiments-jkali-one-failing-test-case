# todos 

* Thoughts on recurring reminders
  * occurences savea 'when' column, that re-evaluates everything the reminder is run.   needs to be intelligent for multi day things like `every friday and saturday`

* minor bugs
  * ensure day/date select automatically selects 9AM 
  * the word 'to' needs to be removed from start of a message
  * day/date reminders need to be at 9am us with at
  * error response needs to have 'show some examples button'
  * Quote blocks need to be respected " food"
  * 'on' dates need 'at' after support
    *  e.g. `/remind me foo on Friday at 12pm`
  
* upcoming features
  * create configuation for postgresql
    * 9.4.15-0+deb8u1  (test locally with docker)
  * snooze choices 
    * (currently only 20 minutes)
    * try reappearing buttons?  or initial row of buttons...
    * awaiting [Interactive message button dropdown](https://forum.mattermost.org/t/interactive-message-button-dropdown/5219)
