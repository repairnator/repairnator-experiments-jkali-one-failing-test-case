ABOUT:

This package a contains a standalone executable ELK Reasoner with a simple
command-line interface. 

REQUIREMENTS:

Java ${java.required.version} or higher.

QUICK START:

To load the ontology from the file ontology.owl, compute its classification
and store the result in taxonomy.owl, run ELK as follows: 

    java -jar ${elk-cli.filename}.jar -i ontology.owl -c -o taxonomy.owl

Without the switch "-o taxonomy.owl" ELK will still compute the result but it
will neither store nor display the result anywhere; this can be used for 
performance experiments.

USAGE:

To display all available options run:
  
    java -jar ${elk-cli.filename}.jar -h

You may want to specify further Java parameters for increasing available memory
for classifying larger ontologies, e.g. by setting

    java -Xms256M -Xmx3G -jar ${elk-cli.filename}.jar
    
or    

    java -XX:+AggressiveHeap -jar ${elk-cli.filename}.jar	

If ELK cannot parse your ontology, this is probably because it is in the
RDF/XML syntax. ELK can only parse ontologies in OWL 2 Functional-Style Syntax.
OWL ontologies in other formats can be converted into Functional-Style Syntax
using Protege version 4.1 or higher. To convert a file, open it in Protege and
save using the menu: File > Save as... > OWL Functional Syntax
