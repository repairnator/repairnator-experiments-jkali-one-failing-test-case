Reactive-gRPC Demos
===================

1. `hello-world` - a simple demo comparing gRPC idioms using raw gRPC and Reactive-gRPC.
2. `reactive-grpc-examples` - miscellaneous examples of Reactive-gRPC techniques.
3. `gradle` - an example of how to use Reactive-gRPC from the Gradle build system.
4. `backpressure-demo` - a GUI demonstration of backpressure in action.
5. `reactive-grpc-chat` - a simple IRC-like chat system implemented using the console, JavaFX, Android, RxJava, Reactor,
   and Kotlin. This is the kitchen sink demo!
