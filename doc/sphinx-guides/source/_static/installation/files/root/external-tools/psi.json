  "description": "The link below goes to a tool that helps data depositors release privacy preserving statistics describing a dataset.\n\nThis is done by distributing a privacy budget across different possible statistical calculations. This tool is called the budgeter. Users select which statistics they would like to calculate and are given estimates of how accurately each statistic can be computed. They can also redistribute their privacy budget according to which statistics they think are most valuable in their dataset.",
