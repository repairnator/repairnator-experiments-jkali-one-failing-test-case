Section 1 - Goals from Past Week

For next week, my goals are as follows:

    -   Finalise the Mathematical Model with Adavya
    -   Collaborate with others to ensure consistency

Section 2 - This week's progress

This week, I worked with Adavya to finalise the Math Model for our class. Additionally, it also occurred to us that since we were dealing with probabilities,
we would need some sort of a 'fraction' class that would keep track of a fraction and give us a clean interface to add numbers to the numerator, the denominator etc.
Since there were no existing classes in the Java Library that accomplished this in the way that we wanted (two int fields: one for numerator, one for denominator),
we decided to create our own Fraction class that we would use in our project.
It was my job to write this class. I have written some part of it and it is my aim that we would not need to make a lot of changes to it later. As a result, I am
giving more thought to the design process and taking things somewhat slowly.

Section 3 - Next Week's Goals

For next week, my goals are as follows:

    -   Complete the Fraction class so that we can use it on the backend
    -   Work with Adavya to have a basic Math Model ready
    -   Coordinate with other team members to ensure consistency overall
