Goals from last week: Last week we began to start creating
a custom junit runner. I was able to create a runner
that can invoke all tests from all test classes,
with out caveat. A super test class with all test classes
had to be made, and had to be hardcoded in.

Goal for this week: Create a test runner that
not only is able to find all test classes in general
(not in hardcode), but is also able to invoke
junit native methods, instead of the rough-draft
way we were doing it, which was by hand.

Goal for next week: Get the runner finalized,
and integrate it into our file processor/math model.
We will then begin testing our design, and seeing how
it reorders tests.
