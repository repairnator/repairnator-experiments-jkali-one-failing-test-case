Week 3 Report
      This week, we will first work on finalizing our file format, so it can be efficient and 
powerful to use. Once the file format is settled, we will start work on extending j-unit and the 
math behind bayes theorem with a moving average. We will technically be split into three 
groups but will collaborate heavily to ensure that our model is consistent. 
      We started work on extending junit so all tests from all test classes can be in a custom 
order. We found a somewhat minimal strategy which involved adding a single class that 
annotates all test classes as suite classes. We have also been able to call each test method and 
get the results of the test by catching (or not receiving) each assertion error. We still need to 
time the execution of each test and see if there is a less invasive way to gain access to all test 
classes at once. The file format has also been formalized: we have decided on one file per suite 
execution stored in json format on a single line with the following data stored for each test: 
method name, pass/fail/ and execution time. This data will be stored a simple tuple (name, 
time), with time being negative for failed tests. 
      Next week we would like to be finished or at least wrapping up our extensions of junit 
and finalize the data structure returned by the bayes group that contains the test ordering. 
Hopefully we will also be able to begin some basic analysis cases.
