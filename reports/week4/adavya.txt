Section 1 - Goals from Past Week

For next week, my goals are as follows:

   -   Finalise the Mathematical Model with Aditya
   -   Make a prototype of methods that produce probability
   -   Collaborate with others to ensure consistency

Section 2 - This week's progress

This week, I worked with Aditya to finalise the Math Model for our class. Additionally, it also occurred to us that since we were dealing with probabilities,
we would need some sort of a 'fraction' class that would keep track of a fraction and give us a clean interface to add numbers to the numerator, the denominator etc.
Since there were no existing classes in the Java Library that accomplished this in the way that we wanted (two int fields: one for numerator, one for denominator),
we decided to create our own Fraction class that we would use in our project.
It was Aditya's job to write this class. 
I on the other hand was focusing on producing the code that would calculate and store probabilities from track files that have all the results of test code. I have
finalised the code that produces total probability and small classes with code will start to be commited once we have the structure of the project more nailed down.
Now I am working on code for coditional probability and how I want to factor in the moving average and the time it takes to run the tests.
Also, I had to read articles on JUnit extension even though I am not working on it to be able to present that topic in the presentations.
Section 3 - Next Week's Goals

For next week, my goals are as follows:

    -   Complete the coditional probability method
    -   Work with Aditya to have a basic Math Model ready
    -   Coordinate with other team members to ensure consistency overall
