Team Name: TestBayes


Team Weekly Report:


1.  Goals-
- More info on extending JUnit - Steven, Ethan, Avidant
- Work on an implementation plan - All team members
- Create code for draft of the method used to order the tests - Adavya and Aditya
- Class to store fractions - Adavya and Aditya.



2. Progress we've made:
- We built the file IO system and the general project structure using maven.
- For the File IO system we are creating multiple files instead of a single file to facilitate easier calculations.
- Conditional probability and total probability calculator methods implemented.
- Method prototypes for test ordering completed, psuedo-code and algorithm structure decided.
- Implementing our own class to save probability and fractions in order to prevent lossy approximations.
- We are implementing 2 classes one for fractions and one for probability.
- Read articles on extending JUnit and how to run JUnit using our own code.
- Made more concrete evaluation plans and came up with bugs we can introduce into programs.



3. Goals for next week:
- Finalize and test the File IO system - Ethan, Avidant, Steven.
- Finalize Mathematical methods - Adavya and Aditya.
- Start collecting data and creating dummy data to test - Everyone
- Work on User Manual, discuss commands etc. - Everyone.
