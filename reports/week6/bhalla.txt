Section 1 - Goals from Past Week

- Complete tests for the conditional probability methods.
- Complete the reorder method.
- Work with teammates on build and testing method.

Section 2 - This week's progress

- Made tests for the Bayes class.
- Started and Finished coding for Bayes class alone, that generates probabilities and gives next test to run.
- Made a list of possible optimizations based on initial results.
- Made many variables parameters to optimize using initial results.

Section 3 - Next Week's Goals

For next week, my goals are as follows:
- Find repositories to build the results to fit mathematical model
- Make changes to the mathematical model
- Finalize the mathematical model based on results
