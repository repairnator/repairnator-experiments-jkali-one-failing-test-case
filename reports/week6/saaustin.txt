  Next week we will report on test outcomes for the single class test runner, and have a final
working product of our runner that picks up all tests from every test class.
  This week we focused mostly on having a buildable working version of our project that is extensively
tested. We accomplished this on our wednedsay and thursday meetings. I wrote several test cases for the 
junit test runner as well as finishing the file output aspect of the runner. The tests cover random ordering
and also verify that the correct output is being produced for tests.
  Next week we will continue writing test cases and improving the build of our project. We will also need 
to find repositories with failing test cases to test our project on.
