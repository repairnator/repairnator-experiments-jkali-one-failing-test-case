Last Weeks Goals:
- Get report completed and updated (for real this time)
- Get runner code integrated with other code
- Write tests for runners

Current Progress:
- Still finding repos that have failed commits to test on

Goals for the week:
- Run some analysis on how our code fairs with injected bugs in cse 331 code (for debugging)
- Run our code on an actual codebase, and generate at least one set of data
