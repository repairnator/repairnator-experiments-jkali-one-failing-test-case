Section 1 - Goals from Past Week

(Empty)

Section 2 - This week's progress

This week, we as a team, discussed how we would go about this project. We divided responsibilities and discussed how we wanted the user to use our product.
We talked about what data we wanted to store and how we could go about storing it. We also discussed the criteria for ordering the tests even though we still
have to finalise the mathematical model yet.
So far, we think that storing the data in a log file is a good idea and the following criteria should play a role in ordering the tests:
    -   The number of passes/fails
    -   The recent history of passes/fails
    -   The time it takes to execute a test

Note that these are all under discussion and can change in the coming week.

Section 3 - Next Week's Goals

For next week, my goals are as follows:

    -   Finalise the Mathematical Model with Adavya
    -   Collaborate with others to ensure consistency
