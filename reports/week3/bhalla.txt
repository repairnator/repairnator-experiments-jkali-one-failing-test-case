Section 1 - Goals from Past Week

(Empty)

Section 2 - This week's progress
We talked about what data we wanted to store and how we could go about storing it. We also discussed the criteria for ordering the tests.
This week, we as a team, discussed how we would go about this project. We divided responsibilities- Me and Aditya will work on the mathematical model
and the methods that produce probabilities using the stored data we have.
We think that storing the data in a log file is a good idea and the following criteria should play a role in ordering the tests:The number of passes/fails, The recent history of passes/fails and The time it takes to execute a test

Note that these are all under discussion and can change in the coming week.

Section 3 - Next Week's Goals

For next week, my goals are as follows:

    -   Finalise the Mathematical Model with Aditya
    -   Make a prototype of methods that produce probability
    -   Collaborate with others to ensure consistency
