-Goals of last week: None.
-
-Current Status: We have targeted the main parts of our project,
-in terms of major components, splitting up the work across
-the team. I have been assigned work with the JUnit framework,
-meaning I will be figuring out how to actually modify JUnit
-to implement our project's functionality. I've found several
-locations of where JUnit actually runs the tests that
-the user wrote.
-
-Goals for next week: My main goal is to actually find
-the correct location of where the tests are run,
-and brainstorm several possible ways of modifying this
-to run tests in a different order.
