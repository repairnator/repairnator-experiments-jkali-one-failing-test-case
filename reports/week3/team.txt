Team Name: TestBayes


Team Weekly Report:


1.  Goals-

- Find out how to extend JUnit - Steven, Ethan, Aditya

- Finalize how data will be stored - Avidant

- Create a draft of the method used to order the tests - Adavya and Satvik



2. Progress we've made:

- We are very close to finalizing how the data will be stored. We plan on using a multi file system. With new files for each execution, so

  as to facilitate easier conditional probability calculation. 

- We have decided to make 2 implementations for the actual test ordering. It is not actually 2 completely different implementations, it is
 
  just the same code but ordered in a different way. The first implementation involves a greedy hueristic where we first run the test with

  the most probability of failing and then based on the outcome of the first test greedily decide which test to run next based on
 
  conditional probability. We would break ties on the greedy decisions by factoring in time taken to run test, conditional probability, 

  total probability and a running average. The second implementation would be to just use everything from the start instead of waiting
 
  for ties.

- Method prototypes for test ordering completed, psuedo-code and algorithm structure decided.

- Implementing our own class to save probability as fractions in order to prevent lossy approximations.

- Read articles on extending JUnit and how to run JUnit using our own code.



3. Goals for next week:
