Last Weeks Goals:
- Be able to pick the order of tests based on our decision
- Ensure that the data read is convenient for data processing

Current Progress:
- We are working on how to collect the data needed to log the results of the test
- Going to test the reordering using other code-bases

Goals for the week:
- Be able to analyze how much our code helps speed up the testing process on a small code-base
