Team Name: TestBayes


Team Weekly Report:


3. Goals:
- Finalize and test the File IO system - Ethan, Avidant, Steven.
- Finalize Mathematical methods - Adavya and Aditya.
- Start collecting data and creating dummy data to test - Everyone
- Work on User Manual, discuss commands etc. - Everyone.
- Finish Conditional probability implementation - Adavya.
- Finalize probability class - Aditya.
- Write tests for each unit in project - Everyone.


2. Progress we've made:
- Finished all modules, still need to possibly tweak fraction class and reorder module.
- Finished unit tests for several modules, including- FileIO, conditional probability generator, individual probability generator.
- Finished each modules code, and finished JUnit test reordering main code.
- Got main module modified to support json for logging.
- Initial Mathematical model finalized (subject to change based on initial results).


3. Goals for next week:
- Find data sets to test - Everyone.
- Begin actual generation of data set results - Everyone
- Start optimization of mathematical models based on initial results - Adavya.
- Work on reports more closely, physically together - Everyone.
