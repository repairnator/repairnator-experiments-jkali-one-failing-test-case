Goals from last week: Get the test runner code written,
successfully reorder tests.

Goal for this week: Get the runner code integrated
with the logger code and math model, and test
how tests reoder with our cse 331 code. Ideally, we want to
have our code essentially finalized, and begin testing 
near the end of this week.

Goals for next week: Start generating actual
results and data of 331 code, and possibly
being tearing up a github codebase online,
and cause it to fail tests, then run
our tool on this system.
