  Next week we would like to be finished or at least wrapping up our extensions of junit 
and finalize the data structure returned by the bayes group that contains the test ordering. 
Hopefully we will also be able to begin some basic analysis cases. 
  We continued on work with junit to be able to call all test methods from all test classes
and run them at the same time (in our chosen ordering, as decided by the bayes people). This 
still appears to be a slight hack as we are not sure if the methods are beign run with standard 
junit after being extracted from their classes. To address this concern, we also added an 
individual test class runner to to the test case reordering within classes, as opposed to 
reordering the entire suite at once. 
  Next week we will report on test outcomes for the single class test runner, and have a final
working product of our runner that picks up all tests from every test class.
