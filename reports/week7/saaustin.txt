  Next week we will report on test outcomes for the single class test runner, and have a final
working product of our runner that picks up all tests from every test class.
  This week we will be fixing our reports to satify class requirements. we are desperate for any credit whatsoever on our submissions. 
  Next week we will also be satisfying class requiremetns and doing everything required to recieve the most basic credit for the class. Nothing else is of any importance, incleding any realistic progress in our project, 
  Only class credit matters, nothing else. I am utterly unconcerned with the results of the project at this point unless i am graded well. You have successfully stampped out the last of my passion
