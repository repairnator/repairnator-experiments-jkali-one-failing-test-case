If an issued [Command](basic-signals-command.html) could not be applied an appropriate error response conveys this
information back to the issuer.
Failure of a command can have various reasons, starting from missing permissions to internal server errors during 
processing of the command.

An overview of all Thing-related error responses can be found in the examples chapter
["Error responses"](protocol-examples-errorresponses.html) of the Ditto Protocol.
