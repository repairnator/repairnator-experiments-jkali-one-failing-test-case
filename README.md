# Repairnator: a program repair bot for continuous integration

Repairnator is a software development bot that automatically repairs build failures on Travis CI.
It scans failing Travis builds, tries to locally reproduce the failing build die to test failures and tries to repair it with a program repair tool (eg Nopol or Astor). 

See [How to Design a Program Repair Bot? Insights from the Repairnator Project](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01691496/document) (Simon Urli, Zhongxing Yu, Lionel Seinturier, Martin Monperrus). In Proceedings of 40th International Conference on Software Engineering, Track Software Engineering in Practice (SEIP), 2018.

## Quickstart

### Requirements

In order to run Repairnator with the provided scripts, you'll need: 
  - git
  - docker
  - uuidgen utility tools (available for Mac & Linux)
  - a Github API key (Go to [Github Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens), and click on "Generate new token".)
  
### Setup Repairnator

All Repairnator scripts are located in the directory `repairnator/scripts`. 
The scripts use the global configuration set in `repairnator/scripts/config/repairnator.cfg`.
You can define your own configuration in a file `repairnator.cfg` located in your home.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Spirals-Team/repairnator/
cd repairnator

# edit the file to specify the mandatory elements (you must add the Github Personal Access Token here)
cp repairnator/scripts/config/repairnator.cfg ~
vi ~/repairnator.cfg
```

### Launch Repairnator on a given Travis Build ID

From a Travis URL like this one: https://travis-ci.org/surli/test-repairnator/builds/352395977 you can retrieve a Build ID by taking the last part of the URL.
Here it is: `352395977`.

All you have to do, to launch Repairnator to reproduce and try fixing this build is then to go in `repairnator/scripts/` and launch `repair_buggy_build.sh` with the build ID as argument:

```bash
# set $HOME_REPAIR and $GITHUB_OAUTH in repairnator/scripts/config/repairnator.cfg
cp repairnator/scripts/config/repairnator.cfg ~
vi ~/repairnator.cfg

cd repairnator/scripts

# start a docker container and run Repairnator on your specified Build ID.
./repair_buggy_build.sh 352395977

# When the docker container is done you can find logs and serialized files in the `$HOME_REPAIR/logs` path.
ls $HOME_REPAIR/logs
```

### Launch Repairnator to analyze and repair failing builds in real-time

You can launch Repairnator to analyze Travis CI builds in realtime and to repair failing ones.

First open your `repairnator.cfg` config file (see above) and edit the values under `Realtime scanner configuration` section:
  - `DURATION` is an optional value: if the value is left blank, the process will never stop; else it will last the specified duration (pay attention on the format, see: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations))
  - `WHITELIST_PATH` and `BLACKLIST_PATH` can be left on the default value, or you can use the files available in `repairnator/repairnator-realtime/src/main/resources`
  
Then just run the script `launch_rtscanner.sh`.

* this generates build reproduction info and patches as local files in a folder called `logs/`
* in this default setup, no MongoDB is used, no email notification is done

For more information about the configuration of a Repairnator instance:

* check out [this page](/doc/usage.md).
* the MongoDB configuration is explained in `repairnator.cfg`
* the email configuration is explained in `repairnator.cfg`


## Content of the repository

This repository is organized as following:

  * [doc](/doc) contains some documentation about Repairnator and its usage
  * [Repairnator](/repairnator) is the main program dedicated to this project: it can automatically scan large set of projects, detect failing builds, reproduce them and try to repair them using our tools
  * [bears-usage](/bears-usage) is a side project dedicated to gather data from repairnator.json files
  * [resources](/resources) contains mainly data produced by Repairnator and scripts to retrieve those data. It also contain the schema of repairnator.json files.
  * [website](/website) contains all data to produce repairnator website
  
Each directory contains its own Readme explaining its own internal organization.
