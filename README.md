From wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient-derived_tumor_xenograft], 
>Patient derived sample xenografts (PDTX) are created when cancerous tissue from a patientâ€™s primary sample is implanted directly into an immunodeficient mouse. PDTX models are providing solutions to the challenges that researchers face in cancer drug research such as positive sample responses in mouse models but not translating over when the study is implemented in humans. As a result, PDTX cancer models are becoming popular models to use in cancer drug research.

The PDX finder project aims to integrate, standardize, analyze, and visualize data from labs performing PDX studies.  PDXfinder.org will make this PDX data findable and accessible for the worldwide community of cancer researchers.

The PDX finder project provides a web portal which provides searching and displaying associated PDX data, including:
 - sample genomic data
 - metrics on sample response to chemotherapeutics
 - host mouse strain metadata
 - histopathological image data
 - molecular classification of tumors
 - etc.
