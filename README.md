Introduction
===========

The primary function of the NetarchiveSuite is to plan, schedule and
archive web harvests of parts of the internet using the open source webcrawler Heritrix from Internet Archives. 

The NetarchiveSuite is a complete web archiving software package developed from 2004 and onwards. 
The primary function of the NetarchiveSuite is to plan, schedule and run web harvests of parts of the Internet. 
It scales to a wide range of tasks, from small, thematic harvests (e.g. related to special events, or special 
domains) to harvesting and archiving the content of an entire national domain. The software has built-in bit 
preservation functionality. The systems architecture allows for the software to be distributed among several 
machines, possibly on more than one geographical location. 

See the [wiki documentation](https://sbforge.org/display/NAS/Documentation) for further details.
