phoss SMP is a complete SMP server that supports both the PEPPOL SMP specification as well as the OASIS BDXR SMP 1.0 specification.
It comes with a management GUI and an XML backend for simplified operations.  
It was the first SMP to be [CEF eDelivery conformant](https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/OASIS+SMP+conformant+solutions).
