Apache ServiceComb (incubating) Saga is an eventually data consistency solution for micro-service applications. Transactions are commited directly in the try phase and compensated in reverse order in the rollback phase comparing to [TCC](http://design.inf.usi.ch/sites/default/files/biblio/rest-tcc.pdf). 

## Features
* High availability. The coordinator is stateless and thus can have multiple instances.
* High reliability. All transaction events are stored in database permanently.
* High performance. Transaction events are reported to coordinator via gRPC and transaction payloads are serialized/deserialized by Kyro.
* Low invasion. All you need to do is add 2-3 annotations and the corresponding compensate methods.
* Easy to deploy. All components can boot via docker.
* Support both forward(retry) and backward(compensate) recovery.

## Architecture
Saga is composed of  **alpha** and **omega**.
* The alpha plays as the coordinator. It is responsible for the management of transactions.
* The omega plays as an agent inside the micro-service. It intercepts incoming/outgoing requests and reports transaction events to alpha.

The following diagram shows the relationships among alpha, omega and services.
