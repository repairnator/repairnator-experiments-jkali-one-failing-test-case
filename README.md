# JKali Patches associated with Travis CI builds having only one failing test case

This is an open-science repository that collects the Kali patches generated by [Repairnator](https://github.com/eclipse/repairnator) during the analysis of the Travis CI builds characterised by only one failing test case and no test cases with errors.

This repository aims to contain the code of the failing Java projects and to analyze the Kali patches generated using [AstorJKali](https://github.com/SpoonLabs/astor#jkali).

## Content of the repository

The structure of the repository is as follows:

- Branch `master` contains the `jkali-patches` folder and the documentation of this repository;
- The `jkali-patches` folder contains the patches generated by Repairnator analyzing the Travis CI build failure related to Java programs that use Maven as building tool;
- For each of these failing builds, there is a specific branch with all the information related to the building of the project, bug reproduction, failing tests and repair attempts.

## Statistics

There are currently 1.685 branches, each of them associated with a failure, and there are 72 Kali patches.
