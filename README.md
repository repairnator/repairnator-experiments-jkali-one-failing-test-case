Test Bayes User Manual

Reason For Use: Test Bayes is a tool designed to speed up the testing process of development significantly. Testing is a static process, that can cause developers to waste a lot of time waiting for certain tests to fail. However, with Test Bayes, tests that are likely to fail on the next run are run with higher priority, meaning they will fail first, instead of later, saving the developer a lot of time testing. This speeds up the development process significantly. Test Bayes is built off of JUnit4, a very common Java test framework, making it compatible with many projects. Test Bayes uses a Bayes oriented mathematical model to determine probabilities of test failures, and orders them accordingly.

Use: Test Bayes utilizes the maven build system to get its information about tests. By specifying the test directories in the pom.xml file, Test Bayes can find all of the tests that are to be run. By including our project in the same directory as the pom.xml, Test Bayes can function properly. Since this project is a build-off of JUnit4, JUnit4 must also be installed in the project. Test Bayes is interfaced through a terminal. There are several commands that can be used to run tests, as follows:  
     tb						: Runs all tests in pom file.  
     -h					: Display command help info.  
     -d testDir1 testDir2 …		: Runs all tests in given 
						  directories instead of all 
						  tests.  
     -u 					: Will not reorder tests to be run.  
     --avg=numTestRuns           : Set the number of test runs
						  to consider in the calculations.  
     --eps=doubleValue	          : Set the failure probability 
						  difference between tests. 
     -c					: Clear all test data.  
     -n					: Treat new tests as if they are 
						  not similar in fail rate to other
						  test runs of other methods  

After running Test Bayes, test results will be output to the console (terminal) in the order they were run, or if the command   was a parameter modification, no output will be produced. Test Bayes test runs are versioned, in that the output from test runs will be   stored in files in the directory the tool is in, making the reordering exist across different machines running the code.  

Customizable inputs-
	You will be able to customize the following things according to need:
* New tests - You can decide whether tests that have no previous runs will be run first, or just treated like tests with the most average stats out of all. This means that a new test will not be given a 50/50 chance of passing or failing, but instead will be treated as if it were similar to other tests, and will be given the average failure rate of all other tests about to be run. This would be specified with the -n flag in the command entered.
+ Moving average - You can decide what number of runs you want to include in the calculation of the moving average. While this is not the only parameter our code uses to compute the order of tests, it is certainly a big part of it, and we want to be able to adapt to your needs as much as possible. This can be set in the pom.xml file, through the --avg flag command, as described above. The default value for this moving average value is 20 test runs.
+ Test Similarity - You can finetune an epsilon parameter, which is a decimal value from 0.0 to 1.0, and determines how similar two tests’ failure rates can be so as to order by time instead of failure rate. This can be set in the pom.xml file, through the --eps flag command, as described above. For example, if epsilon was set to 0.01, and two tests had failure rates of 0.94 and 0.95, but the second test was double as long, the first (shorter) test would be run. The default value for epsilon is 0.03.


Similar work: Most work related to our project are frameworks that allow for didn’t types of testing, rather than the actual act of reordering tests. One framework that is popular is the Spring Framework (7), which is designed around testing a program by giving control flow back the to framework (often called Inversion of Control, or IoC). However, this is (as previously stated), more concerned with the type of testing, rather than test reordering itself. After searching on github, and google scholar, the only thing similar to our project was a research paper conducted on the time benefits of reordering test based on test failure rates. The paper stated that “the effectiveness of prioritization techniques… on JUnit has not been investigated” (6). However, the paper stated that “numerous empirical studies have shown that prioritization can improve a test suite's rate of fault detection” (6), showing that our project has promise in being a useful tool for people to use.
