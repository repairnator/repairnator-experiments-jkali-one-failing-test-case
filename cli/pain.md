## Pain Points

Pain points of the actual launcher.

## Launcher Architecture

Launcher contains multiple methods, each commands is a method. The logic is not
very clear and hard to read.

## Method pkgRequest

The method `pkgRequest` is very confusing. Actually:

- **mp-hotfix** is resolved as a mp-request before being executed.
- **mp-purge** is resolved as a mp-request before being executed.
- **mp-upgrade** is resolved as a mp-request before being executed.

So it means that **mp-hotfix**, **mp-purge**, **mp-upgrade** are all composite
commands. Composite commands are composed by multiple unit commands. Among these
unit commands, some of them might require launcher to restartâ€”a pending queue is
required to resume the remaining actions.

Confusing points:

- Too many inputs for a `pkgRequest`.
- Notion of composite command and unit command.
- `pkgRequest` is not only a request, but also implies resolution.
- How to resume pending tasks or pending commands?

## Test TestConnectBroker

- The list of package status is hidden in `.package`.
- It asserts log.
- It stores binaries, e.g. ZIP files.
- The set-up context is too complex.
- It isn't a unit test, it's an integration test.
- Package names are too magic: A, B, C, ...
